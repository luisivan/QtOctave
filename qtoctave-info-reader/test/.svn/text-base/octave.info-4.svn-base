24.1 Linear Programming
=======================

Octave can solve Linear Programming problems using the `glpk' function.
That is, Octave can solve

     min C'*x
   subject to the linear constraints A*x = b where x >= 0.

The `glpk' function also supports variations of this problem.

 -- Function File: [XOPT, FMIN, STATUS, EXTRA] = glpk (C, A, B, LB, UB,
          CTYPE, VARTYPE, SENSE, PARAM)
     Solve a linear program using the GNU GLPK library.  Given three
     arguments, `glpk' solves the following standard LP:

          min C'*x

     subject to

          A*x  = b
            x >= 0

     but may also solve problems of the form

          [ min | max ] C'*x

     subject to

          A*x [ "=" | "<=" | ">=" ] b
            x >= LB
            x <= UB

     Input arguments:

    C
          A column array containing the objective function coefficients.

    A
          A matrix containing the constraints coefficients.

    B
          A column array containing the right-hand side value for each
          constraint in the constraint matrix.

    LB
          An array containing the lower bound on each of the variables.
          If LB is not supplied, the default lower bound for the
          variables is zero.

    UB
          An array containing the upper bound on each of the variables.
          If UB is not supplied, the default upper bound is assumed to
          be infinite.

    CTYPE
          An array of characters containing the sense of each
          constraint in the constraint matrix.  Each element of the
          array may be one of the following values
         `"F"'
               A free (unbounded) constraint (the constraint is
               ignored).

         `"U"'
               An inequality constraint with an upper bound (`A(i,:)*x
               <= b(i)').

         `"S"'
               An equality constraint (`A(i,:)*x = b(i)').

         `"L"'
               An inequality with a lower bound (`A(i,:)*x >= b(i)').

         `"D"'
               An inequality constraint with both upper and lower bounds
               (`A(i,:)*x >= -b(i)' _and_ (`A(i,:)*x <= b(i)').

    VARTYPE
          A column array containing the types of the variables.
         `"C"'
               A continuous variable.

         `"I"'
               An integer variable.

    SENSE
          If SENSE is 1, the problem is a minimization.  If SENSE is
          -1, the problem is a maximization.  The default value is 1.

    PARAM
          A structure containing the following parameters used to
          define the behavior of solver.  Missing elements in the
          structure take on default values, so you only need to set the
          elements that you wish to change from the default.

          Integer parameters:

         `msglev (`LPX_K_MSGLEV', default: 1)'
               Level of messages output by solver routines:
              0
                    No output.

              1
                    Error messages only.

               Scaling option:
              0
                    No scaling.

              1
                    Equilibration scaling.

         `dual	 (`LPX_K_DUAL', default: 0)'
               Dual simplex option:
              0
                    Do not use the dual simplex.

              1
                    If initial basic solution is dual feasible, use the
                    dual simplex.

         `itlim	 (`LPX_K_ITLIM', default: -1)'
               Simplex iterations limit.  If this value is positive, it
               is decreased by one each time when one simplex iteration
               has been performed, and reaching zero value signals the
               solver to stop the search.  Negative value means no
               iterations limit.

         `itcnt (`LPX_K_OUTFRQ', default: 200)'
               Output frequency, in iterations.  This parameter

                    Breadth first search.

              2
                    Backtrack using the best projection heuristic.

         `presol (`LPX_K_PRESOL', default: 1)'
               If this flag is set, the routine lpx_simplex solves the
               problem using the built-in LP presolver.  Otherwise the
               LP presolver is not used.

         `lpsolver (default: 1)'
               Select which solver to use.  If the problem is a MIP
               problem this flag will be ignored.
              1
                    Revised simplex method.

              2
                    Interior point method.

         `save (default: 0)'
               If this parameter is nonzero, save a copy of the problem
               in CPLEX LP format to the file `"outpb.lp"'.  There is
               currently no way to change the name of the output file.

          Real parameters:

         `relax (`LPX_K_RELAX', default: 0.07)'
               Relaxation parameter used in the ratio test.  If it is
               zero, the textbook ratio test is used.  If it is
               non-zero (should be positive), Harris' two-pass ratio
               test is used.  In the latter case on the first pass of
               the ratio test basic variables (in the case of primal
               simplex) or reduced costs of non-basic variables (in the
               case of dual simplex) are allowed to slightly violate
               their bounds, but not more than `relax*tolbnd' or
               `relax*toldj (thus, `relax' is a percentage of `tolbnd'
               or `toldj''.

         `tolbnd (`LPX_K_TOLBND', default: 10e-7)'
               Relative tolerance used to check if the current basic
               solution is primal feasible.  It is not recommended that
               you change this parameter unless you have a detailed
               understanding of its purpose.

         `toldj (`LPX_K_TOLDJ', default: 10e-7)'
               Absolute tolerance used to check if the current basic
               solution is dual feasible.  It is not recommended that
               you change this parameter unless you have a detailed
               understanding of its purpose.

         `tolpiv (`LPX_K_TOLPIV', default: 10e-9)'
               Relative tolerance used to choose eligible pivotal
               elements of the simplex table.  It is not recommended
               that you change this parameter unless you have a
               detailed understanding of its purpose.

         `objll (`LPX_K_OBJLL', default: -DBL_MAX)'
               Lower limit of the objective function.  If on the phase
               II the objective function reaches this limit and
               continues decreasing, the solver stops the search.  This
               parameter is used in the dual simplex method only.

         `objul (`LPX_K_OBJUL', default: +DBL_MAX)'
               Upper limit of the objective function.  If on the phase
               II the objective function reaches this limit and
               continues increasing, the solver stops the search.  This
               parameter is used in the dual simplex only.

         `tmlim (`LPX_K_TMLIM', default: -1.0)'
               Searching time limit, in seconds.  If this value is
               positive, it is decreased each time when one simplex
               iteration has been performed by the amount of time spent
               for the iteration, and reaching zero value signals the
               solver to stop the search.  Negative value means no time
               limit.

         `outdly (`LPX_K_OUTDLY', default: 0.0)'
               Output delay, in seconds.  This parameter specifies how
               long the solver should delay sending information about
               the solution to the standard output.  Non-positive value
               means no delay.

         `tolint (`LPX_K_TOLINT', default: 10e-5)'
               Relative tolerance used to check if the current basic
               solution is integer feasible.  It is not recommended
               that you change this parameter unless you have a
               detailed understanding of its purpose.

         `tolobj (`LPX_K_TOLOBJ', default: 10e-7)'
               Relative tolerance used to check if the value of the
               objective function is not better than in the best known
               integer feasible solution.  It is not recommended that
               you change this parameter unless you have a detailed
               understanding of its purpose.

24.2 Quadratic Programming
==========================

Octave can also solve Quadratic Programming problems, this is
     min 0.5 x'*H*x + x'*q
   subject to
          A*x = b
          lb <= x <= ub
          A_lb <= A_in*x <= A_ub

 -- Function File: [X, OBJ, INFO, LAMBDA] = qp (X0, H, Q, A, B, LB, UB,
          A_LB, A_IN, A_UB)
     Solve the quadratic program

               min 0.5 x'*H*x + x'*q
                x

     subject to

               A*x = b
               lb <= x <= ub
               A_lb <= A_in*x <= A_ub

     using a null-space active-set method.

     Any bound (A, B, LB, UB, A_LB, A_UB) may be set to the empty
     matrix (`[]') if not present.  If the initial guess is feasible
     the algorithm is faster.

     The value INFO is a structure with the following fields:
    `solveiter'
          The number of iterations required to find the solution.

    `info'
          An integer indicating the status of the solution, as follows:
         0
               The problem is feasible and convex.  Global solution
               found.

         1
               The problem is not convex.  Local solution found.

         2
               The problem is not convex and unbounded.

         3
               Maximum number of iterations reached.

         6
               The problem is infeasible.

24.3 Nonlinear Programming
==========================

Octave can also perform general nonlinear minimization using a
successive quadratic programming solver.

 -- Function File: [X, OBJ, INFO, ITER, NF, LAMBDA] = sqp (X, PHI, G,
          H, LB, UB, MAXITER, TOLERANCE)
     Solve the nonlinear program

               min phi (x)
                x

     subject to

               g(x)  = 0
               h(x) >= 0
               lb <= x <= ub

     using a successive quadratic programming method.

     The first argument is the initial guess for the vector X.

     The second argument is a function handle pointing to the objective
     function.  The objective function must be of the form

               y = phi (x)

     in which X is a vector and Y is a scalar.

     The second argument may also be a 2- or 3-element cell array of
     function handles.  The first element should point to the objective
     function, the second should point to a function that computes the
     gradient of the objective function, and the third should point to a
     function to compute the hessian of the objective function.  If the
     gradient function is not supplied, the gradient is computed by
     finite differences.  If the hessian function is not supplied, a
     BFGS update formula is used to approximate the hessian.

     If supplied, the gradient function must be of the form

          g = gradient (x)

     in which X is a vector and G is a vector.

     If supplied, the hessian function must be of the form

          h = hessian (x)

     in which X is a vector and H is a matrix.

     The third and fourth arguments are function handles pointing to
     functions that compute the equality constraints and the inequality
     constraints, respectively.

     If your problem does not have equality (or inequality) constraints,
     you may pass an empty matrix for CEF (or CIF).

     If supplied, the equality and inequality constraint functions must
     be of the form

          r = f (x)

     in which X is a vector and R is a vector.

     The third and fourth arguments may also be 2-element cell arrays of
     function handles.  The first element should point to the constraint
     function and the second should point to a function that computes
     the gradient of the constraint function:

                          [ d f(x)   d f(x)        d f(x) ]
              transpose ( [ ------   -----   ...   ------ ] )
                          [  dx_1     dx_2          dx_N  ]

     The fifth and sixth arguments are vectors containing lower and
     upper bounds on X.  These must be consistent with equality and
     inequality constraints G and H.  If the bounds are not specified,
     or are empty, they are set to -REALMAX and REALMAX by default.

     The seventh argument is max. number of iterations.  If not
     specified, the default value is 100.

     The eighth argument is tolerance for stopping criteria.  If not
     specified, the default value is EPS.

     Here is an example of calling `sqp':

          function r = g (x)
            r = [ sumsq(x)-10;
                  x(2)*x(3)-5*x(4)*x(5);
                  x(1)^3+x(2)^3+1 ];
          endfunction

          function obj = phi (x)
            obj = exp(prod(x)) - 0.5*(x(1)^3+x(2)^3+1)^2;
          endfunction

          x0 = [-1.8; 1.7; 1.9; -0.8; -0.8];

          [x, obj, info, iter, nf, lambda] = sqp (x0, @phi, @g, [])

          x =

            -1.71714
             1.59571
             1.82725
            -0.76364
            -0.76364

          obj = 0.053950
          info = 101
          iter = 8
          nf = 10
          lambda =

            -0.0401627
             0.0379578
            -0.0052227

     The value returned in INFO may be one of the following:
    101
          The algorithm terminated because the norm of the last step
          was less than `tol * norm (x))' (the value of tol is
          currently fixed at `sqrt (eps)'--edit `sqp.m' to modify this
          value.

    102
          The BFGS update failed.

    103
          The maximum number of iterations was reached (the maximum
          number of allowed iterations is currently fixed at 100--edit
          `sqp.m' to increase this value).

24.4 Linear Least Squares
=========================

Octave also supports linear least squares minimization.  That is,
Octave can find the parameter b such that the model y = x*b fits data
(x,y) as well as possible, assuming zero-mean Gaussian noise.  If the
noise is assumed to be isotropic the problem can be solved using the
`\' or `/' operators, or the `ols' function.  In the general case where
the noise is assumed to be anisotropic the `gls' is needed.

25 Statistics
*************

Octave has support for various statistical methods.  This includes
basic descriptive statistics, statistical tests, random number
generation, and much more.

   The functions that analyze data all assume that multidimensional data
is arranged in a matrix where each row is an observation, and each
column is a variable.  So, the matrix defined by

     a = [ 0.9, 0.7;
           0.1, 0.1;
           0.5, 0.4 ];

contains three observations from a two-dimensional distribution.  While
this is the default data arrangement, most functions support different
arrangements.

   It should be noted that the statistics functions don't test for data
containing NaN, NA, or Inf.  Such values need to be handled explicitly.

File: octave.info,  Node: Descriptive Statistics,  Next: Basic Statistical Functions,  Up: Statistics

25.1 Descriptive Statistics
===========================

Octave can compute various statistics such as the moments of a data set.

 -- Function File:  mean (X, DIM, OPT)
     If X is a vector, compute the mean of the elements of X

          mean (x) = SUM_i x(i) / N
     If X is a matrix, compute the mean for each column and return them
     in a row vector.

     With the optional argument OPT, the kind of mean computed can be
     selected.  The following options are recognized:

    `"a"'
          Compute the (ordinary) arithmetic mean.  This is the default.

    `"g"'
          Compute the geometric mean.

    `"h"'
          Compute the harmonic mean.

     If the optional argument DIM is supplied, work along dimension DIM.

     Both DIM and OPT are optional.  If both are supplied, either may
     appear first.

 -- Function File:  median (X, DIM)
     If X is a vector, compute the median value of the elements of X.
     If the elements of X are sorted, the median is defined as

                      x(ceil(N/2)),             N odd
          median(x) =
                      (x(N/2) + x((N/2)+1))/2,  N even
     If X is a matrix, compute the median value for each column and
     return them in a row vector.  If the optional DIM argument is
     given, operate along this dimension.

     *See also:* *note std: doc-std, *note mean: doc-mean.

 -- Function File: Q = quantile (X, P)
 -- Function File: Q = quantile (X, P, DIM)
 -- Function File: Q = quantile (X, P, DIM, METHOD)
     For a sample, X, calculate the quantiles, Q, corresponding to the
     cumulative probability values in P.  All non-numeric values (NaNs)
     of X are ignored.

     If X is a matrix, compute the quantiles for each column and return
     them in a matrix, such that the i-th row of Q contains the P(i)th
     quantiles of each column of X.

     The optional argument DIM determines the dimension along which the
     percentiles are calculated.  If DIM is omitted, and X is a vector
     or matrix, it defaults to 1 (column wise quantiles).  In the
     instance that X is a N-d array, DIM defaults to the first
     dimension whose size greater than unity.

     The methods available to calculate sample quantiles are the nine
     methods used by R (http://www.r-project.org/).  The default value
     is METHOD = 5.

     Discontinuous sample quantile methods 1, 2, and 3

       1. Method 1: Inverse of empirical distribution function.

       2. Method 2: Similar to method 1 but with averaging at
          discontinuities.

       3. Method 3: SAS definition: nearest even order statistic.

     Continuous sample quantile methods 4 through 9, where p(k) is the
     linear interpolation function respecting each methods'
     representative cdf.

       4. Method 4: p(k) = k / n. That is, linear interpolation of the
          empirical cdf.

       5. Method 5: p(k) = (k - 0.5) / n. That is a piecewise linear
          function where the knots are the values midway through the
          steps of the empirical cdf.

       6. Method 6: p(k) = k / (n + 1).

       7. Method 7: p(k) = (k - 1) / (n - 1).

       8. Method 8: p(k) = (k - 1/3) / (n + 1/3).  The resulting
          quantile estimates are approximately median-unbiased
          regardless of the distribution of X.

       9. Method 9: p(k) = (k - 3/8) / (n + 1/4).  The resulting
          quantile estimates are approximately unbiased for the
          expected order statistics if X is normally distributed.

     Hyndman and Fan (1996) recommend method 8.  Maxima, S, and R
     (versions prior to 2.0.0) use 7 as their default.  Minitab and SPSS
     use method 6.  MATLAB uses method 5.

 -- Function File: Y = prctile (X, P)
 -- Function File: Q = prctile (X, P, DIM)
     For a sample X, compute the quantiles, Y, corresponding to the
     cumulative probability values, P, in percent.  All non-numeric
     values (NaNs) of X are ignored.

     If X is a matrix, compute the percentiles for each column and
     return them in a matrix, such that the i-th row of Y contains the
     P(i)th percentiles of each column of X.

     The optional argument DIM determines the dimension along which the
     percentiles are calculated.  If DIM is omitted, and X is a vector
     or matrix, it defaults to 1 (column wise quantiles).  In the
     instance that X is a N-d array, DIM defaults to the first
     dimension whose size greater than unity.


 -- Function File:  meansq (X)
 -- Function File:  meansq (X, DIM)
     For vector arguments, return the mean square of the values.  For
     matrix arguments, return a row vector containing the mean square
     of each column.  With the optional DIM argument, returns the mean
     squared of the values along this dimension.

 -- Function File:  std (X)
 -- Function File:  std (X, OPT)
 -- Function File:  std (X, OPT, DIM)
     If X is a vector, compute the standard deviation of the elements
     of X.

          std (x) = sqrt (sumsq (x - mean (x)) / (n - 1))
     If X is a matrix, compute the standard deviation for each column
     and return them in a row vector.

     The argument OPT determines the type of normalization to use.
     Valid values are

    0:
          normalizes with N-1, provides the square root of best
          unbiased estimator of   the variance [default]

    1:
          normalizes with N, this provides the square root of the
          second moment around   the mean

     The third argument DIM determines the dimension along which the
     standard deviation is calculated.

     *See also:* *note mean: doc-mean, *note median: doc-median.

 -- Function File:  var (X)
     For vector arguments, return the (real) variance of the values.
     For matrix arguments, return a row vector containing the variance
     for each column.

     The argument OPT determines the type of normalization to use.
     Valid values are

    0:
          Normalizes with N-1, provides the best unbiased estimator of
          the variance [default].

    1:
          Normalizes with N, this provides the second moment around the
          mean.

     The third argument DIM determines the dimension along which the
     variance is calculated.

 -- Function File: [M, F, C] = mode (X, DIM)
     Count the most frequently appearing value.  `mode' counts the
     frequency along the first non-singleton dimension and if two or
     more values have the same frequency returns the smallest of the
     two in M.  The dimension along which to count can be specified by
     the DIM parameter.

     The variable F counts the frequency of each of the most frequently
     occurring elements.  The cell array C contains all of the elements
     with the maximum frequency .

 -- Function File:  cov (X, Y)
     Compute covariance.

     If each row of X and Y is an observation and each column is a
     variable, the (I, J)-th entry of `cov (X, Y)' is the covariance
     between the I-th variable in X and the J-th variable in Y.  If
     called with one argument, compute `cov (X, X)'.

 -- Function File:  cor (X, Y)
     Compute correlation.

     The (I, J)-th entry of `cor (X, Y)' is the correlation between the
     I-th variable in X and the J-th variable in Y.

          corrcoef(x,y) = cov(x,y)/(std(x)*std(y))

     For matrices, each row is an observation and each column a
     variable; vectors are always observations and may be row or column
     vectors.

     `cor (X)' is equivalent to `cor (X, X)'.

     Note that the `corrcoef' function does the same as `cor'.

 -- Function File:  corrcoef (X, Y)
     Compute correlation.

     If each row of X and Y is an observation and each column is a
     variable, the (I, J)-th entry of `corrcoef (X, Y)' is the
     correlation between the I-th variable in X and the J-th variable
     in Y.

          corrcoef(x,y) = cov(x,y)/(std(x)*std(y))

     If called with one argument, compute `corrcoef (X, X)'.

 -- Function File:  kurtosis (X, DIM)
     If X is a vector of length N, return the kurtosis

          kurtosis (x) = N^(-1) std(x)^(-4) sum ((x - mean(x)).^4) - 3

     of X.  If X is a matrix, return the kurtosis over the first
     non-singleton dimension.  The optional argument DIM can be given
     to force the kurtosis to be given over that dimension.

 -- Function File:  skewness (X, DIM)
     If X is a vector of length n, return the skewness

          skewness (x) = N^(-1) std(x)^(-3) sum ((x - mean(x)).^3)

     of X.  If X is a matrix, return the skewness along the first
     non-singleton dimension of the matrix.  If the optional DIM
     argument is given, operate along this dimension.

 -- Function File:  statistics (X)
     If X is a matrix, return a matrix with the minimum, first
     quartile, median, third quartile, maximum, mean, standard
     deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the columns of X as its
     columns.

     If X is a vector, calculate the statistics along the non-singleton
     dimension.

 -- Function File:  moment (X, P, OPT, DIM)
     If X is a vector, compute the P-th moment of X.

     If X is a matrix, return the row vector containing the P-th moment
     of each column.

     With the optional string opt, the kind of moment to be computed can
     be specified.  If opt contains `"c"' or `"a"', central and/or
     absolute moments are returned.  For example,

          moment (x, 3, "ac")

     computes the third central absolute moment of X.

     If the optional argument DIM is supplied, work along dimension DIM.

25.2 Basic Statistical Functions
================================

Octave also supports various helpful statistical functions.

 -- Function File:  mahalanobis (X, Y)
     Return the Mahalanobis' D-square distance between the multivariate
     samples X and Y, which must have the same number of components
     (columns), but may have a different number of observations (rows).

 -- Function File:  center (X)
 -- Function File:  center (X, DIM)
     If X is a vector, subtract its mean.  If X is a matrix, do the
     above for each column.  If the optional argument DIM is given,
     perform the above operation along this dimension

 -- Function File:  studentize (X, DIM)
     If X is a vector, subtract its mean and divide by its standard
     deviation.

     If X is a matrix, do the above along the first non-singleton
     dimension.  If the optional argument DIM is given then operate
     along this dimension.

 -- Function File: C = nchoosek (N, K)
     Compute the binomial coefficient or all combinations of N.  If N
     is a scalar then, calculate the binomial coefficient of N and K,
     defined as

           /   \
           | n |    n (n-1) (n-2) ... (n-k+1)       n!
           |   |  = ------------------------- =  ---------
           | k |               k!                k! (n-k)!
           \   /

     If N is a vector generate all combinations of the elements of N,
     taken K at a time, one row per combination.  The resulting C has
     size `[nchoosek (length (N), K), K]'.

     `nchoosek' works only for non-negative integer arguments; use
     `bincoeff' for non-integer scalar arguments and for using vector
     arguments to compute many coefficients at once.

     *See also:* *note bincoeff: doc-bincoeff.

 -- Function File: N = histc (Y, EDGES)
 -- Function File: N = histc (Y, EDGES, DIM)
 -- Function File: [N, IDX] = histc (...)
     Produce histogram counts.

     When Y is a vector, the function counts the number of elements of
     Y that fall in the histogram bins defined by EDGES.  This must be
     a vector of monotonically non-decreasing values that define the
     edges of the histogram bins.  So, `N (k)' contains the number of
     elements in Y for which `EDGES (k) <= Y < EDGES (k+1)'.  The final
     element of N contains the number of elements of Y that was equal
     to the last element of EDGES.

     When Y is a N-dimensional array, the same operation as above is
     repeated along dimension DIM.  If this argument is given, the
     operation is performed along the first non-singleton dimension.

     If a second output argument is requested an index matrix is also
     returned.  The IDX matrix has same size as Y.  Each element of IDX
     contains the index of the histogram bin in which the corresponding
     element of Y was counted.

     *See also:* *note hist: doc-hist.

 -- Function File:  perms (V)
     Generate all permutations of V, one row per permutation.  The
     result has size `factorial (N) * N', where N is the length of V.

     As an example, `perms([1, 2, 3])' returns the matrix
            1   2   3
            2   1   3
            1   3   2
            2   3   1
            3   1   2
            3   2   1

 -- Function File:  values (X)
     Return the different values in a column vector, arranged in
     ascending order.

     As an example, `values([1, 2, 3, 1])' returns the vector `[1, 2,
     3]'.

 -- Function File: [T, L_X] = table (X)
 -- Function File: [T, L_X, L_Y] = table (X, Y)
     Create a contingency table T from data vectors.  The L vectors are
     the corresponding levels.

     Currently, only 1- and 2-dimensional tables are supported.

 -- Function File:  spearman (X, Y)
     Compute Spearman's rank correlation coefficient RHO for each of
     the variables specified by the input arguments.

     For matrices, each row is an observation and each column a
     variable; vectors are always observations and may be row or column
     vectors.

     `spearman (X)' is equivalent to `spearman (X, X)'.

     For two data vectors X and Y, Spearman's RHO is the correlation of
     the ranks of X and Y.

     If X and Y are drawn from independent distributions, RHO has zero
     mean and variance `1 / (n - 1)', and is asymptotically normally
     distributed.

 -- Function File:  run_count (X, N)
     Count the upward runs along the first non-singleton dimension of X
     of length 1, 2, ..., N-1 and greater than or equal to N.  If the
     optional argument DIM is given operate along this dimension

 -- Function File:  ranks (X, DIM)
     Return the ranks of X along the first non-singleton dimension
     adjust for ties.  If the optional argument DIM is given, operate
     along this dimension.

 -- Function File:  range (X)
 -- Function File:  range (X, DIM)
     If X is a vector, return the range, i.e., the difference between
     the maximum and the minimum, of the input data.

     If X is a matrix, do the above for each column of X.

     If the optional argument DIM is supplied, work along dimension DIM.

 -- Function File:  probit (P)
     For each component of P, return the probit (the quantile of the
     standard normal distribution) of P.

 -- Function File:  logit (P)
     For each component of P, return the logit of P defined as
          logit(P) = log (P / (1-P))

 -- Function File:  cloglog (X)
     Return the complementary log-log function of X, defined as

          cloglog(x) = - log (- log (X))

 -- Function File:  kendall (X, Y)
     Compute Kendall's TAU for each of the variables specified by the
     input arguments.

     For matrices, each row is an observation and each column a
     variable; vectors are always observations and may be row or column
     vectors.

     `kendall (X)' is equivalent to `kendall (X, X)'.

     For two data vectors X, Y of common length N, Kendall's TAU is the
     correlation of the signs of all rank differences of X and Y;
     i.e., if both X and Y have distinct entries, then

                   1
          tau = -------   SUM sign (q(i) - q(j)) * sign (r(i) - r(j))
                n (n-1)   i,j

     in which the Q(I) and R(I)  are the ranks of X and Y, respectively.

     If X and Y are drawn from independent distributions, Kendall's TAU
     is asymptotically normal with mean 0 and variance `(2 * (2N+5)) /
     (9 * N * (N-1))'.

 -- Function File:  iqr (X, DIM)
     If X is a vector, return the interquartile range, i.e., the
     difference between the upper and lower quartile, of the input data.

     If X is a matrix, do the above for first non-singleton dimension
     of X.  If the option DIM argument is given, then operate along
     this dimension.

 -- Function File:  cut (X, BREAKS)
     Create categorical data out of numerical or continuous data by
     cutting into intervals.

     If BREAKS is a scalar, the data is cut into that many equal-width
     intervals.  If BREAKS is a vector of break points, the category
     has `length (BREAKS) - 1' groups.

     The returned value is a vector of the same size as X telling which
     group each point in X belongs to.  Groups are labelled from 1 to
     the number of groups; points outside the range of BREAKS are
     labelled by `NaN'.

25.3 Statistical Plots
======================

Octave can create Quantile Plots (QQ-Plots), and Probability Plots
(PP-Plots).  These are simple graphical tests for determining if a data
set comes from a certain distribution.

   Note that Octave can also show histograms of data using the `hist'
function as described in *note Two-Dimensional Plots::.

 -- Function File: [Q, S] = qqplot (X, DIST, PARAMS)
     Perform a QQ-plot (quantile plot).

     If F is the CDF of the distribution DIST with parameters PARAMS
     and G its inverse, and X a sample vector of length N, the QQ-plot
     graphs ordinate S(I) = I-th largest element of x versus abscissa
     Q(If) = G((I - 0.5)/N).

     If the sample comes from F except for a transformation of location
     and scale, the pairs will approximately follow a straight line.

     The default for DIST is the standard normal distribution.  The
     optional argument PARAMS contains a list of parameters of DIST.
     For example, for a quantile plot of the uniform distribution on
     [2,4] and X, use

          qqplot (x, "uniform", 2, 4)

     DIST can be any string for which a function DIST_INV that
     calculates the inverse CDF of distribution DIST exists.

     If no output arguments are given, the data are plotted directly.

 -- Function File: [P, Y] = ppplot (X, DIST, PARAMS)
     Perform a PP-plot (probability plot).

     If F is the CDF of the distribution DIST with parameters PARAMS
     and X a sample vector of length N, the PP-plot graphs ordinate
     Y(I) = F (I-th largest element of X) versus abscissa P(I) = (I -
     0.5)/N.  If the sample comes from F, the pairs will approximately
     follow a straight line.

     The default for DIST is the standard normal distribution.  The
     optional argument PARAMS contains a list of parameters of DIST.
     For example, for a probability plot of the uniform distribution on
     [2,4] and X, use

          ppplot (x, "uniform", 2, 4)

     DIST can be any string for which a function DIST_CDF that
     calculates the CDF of distribution DIST exists.

     If no output arguments are given, the data are plotted directly.

25.4 Tests
==========

Octave can perform several different statistical tests.  The following
table summarizes the available tests.

*Hypothesis*                  *Test Functions*
Equal mean values             `anova', `hotelling_test2',
                              `t_test_2',        `welch_test',
                              `wilcoxon_test', `z_test_2'
Equal medians                 `kruskal_wallis_test', `sign_test'
Equal variances               `bartlett_test', `manova',
                              `var_test'
Equal distributions           `chisquare_test_homogeneity',
                              `kolmogorov_smirnov_test_2',
                              `u_test'
Equal marginal frequencies    `mcnemar_test'
Equal success probabilities   `prop_test_2'
Independent observations      `chisquare_test_independence',
                              `run_test'
Uncorrelated observations     `cor_test'
Given mean value              `hotelling_test', `t_test', `z_test'
Observations from given       `kolmogorov_smirnov_test'
distribution                  
Regression                    `f_test_regression',
                              `t_test_regression'

   The tests return a p-value that describes the outcome of the test.
Assuming that the test hypothesis is true, the p-value is the
probability of obtaining a worse result than the observed one.  So
large p-values corresponds to a successful test.  Usually a test
hypothesis is accepted if the p-value exceeds 0.05.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, F, DF_B, DF_W] = anova (Y, G)
     Perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).  The goal is to
     test whether the population means of data taken from K different
     groups are all equal.

     Data may be given in a single vector Y with groups specified by a
     corresponding vector of group labels G (e.g., numbers from 1 to
     K).  This is the general form which does not impose any
     restriction on the number of data in each group or the group
     labels.

     If Y is a matrix and G is omitted, each column of Y is treated as
     a group.  This form is only appropriate for balanced ANOVA in
     which the numbers of samples from each group are all equal.

     Under the null of constant means, the statistic F follows an F
     distribution with DF_B and DF_W degrees of freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at F) is
     returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the standard one-way ANOVA table is
     printed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, CHISQ, DF] = bartlett_test (X1, ...)
     Perform a Bartlett test for the homogeneity of variances in the
     data vectors X1, X2, ..., XK, where K > 1.

     Under the null of equal variances, the test statistic CHISQ
     approximately follows a chi-square distribution with DF degrees of
     freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at CHISQ) is
     returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, CHISQ, DF] = chisquare_test_homogeneity (X,
          Y, C)
     Given two samples X and Y, perform a chisquare test for
     homogeneity of the null hypothesis that X and Y come from the same
     distribution, based on the partition induced by the (strictly
     increasing) entries of C.

     For large samples, the test statistic CHISQ approximately follows a
     chisquare distribution with DF = `length (C)' degrees of freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at CHISQ) is
     returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, CHISQ, DF] = chisquare_test_independence (X)
     Perform a chi-square test for independence based on the contingency
     table X.  Under the null hypothesis of independence, CHISQ
     approximately has a chi-square distribution with DF degrees of
     freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at chisq) of the
     test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- Function File:  cor_test (X, Y, ALT, METHOD)
     Test whether two samples X and Y come from uncorrelated
     populations.

     The optional argument string ALT describes the alternative
     hypothesis, and can be `"!="' or `"<>"' (non-zero), `">"' (greater
     than 0), or `"<"' (less than 0).  The default is the two-sided
     case.

     The optional argument string METHOD specifies on which correlation
     coefficient the test should be based.  If METHOD is `"pearson"'
     (default), the (usual) Pearson's product moment correlation
     coefficient is used.  In this case, the data should come from a
     bivariate normal distribution.  Otherwise, the other two methods
     offer nonparametric alternatives.  If METHOD is `"kendall"', then
     Kendall's rank correlation tau is used.  If METHOD is
     `"spearman"', then Spearman's rank correlation rho is used.  Only
     the first character is necessary.

     The output is a structure with the following elements:

    PVAL
          The p-value of the test.

    STAT
          The value of the test statistic.

    DIST
          The distribution of the test statistic.

    PARAMS
          The parameters of the null distribution of the test statistic.

    ALTERNATIVE
          The alternative hypothesis.

          RR, R)
     Perform an F test for the null hypothesis rr * b = r in a classical
     normal regression model y = X * b + e.

     Under the null, the test statistic F follows an F distribution
     with DF_NUM and DF_DEN degrees of freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at F) is
     returned in PVAL.

     If not given explicitly, R = 0.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, TSQ] = hotelling_test (X, M)
     For a sample X from a multivariate normal distribution with unknown
     mean and covariance matrix, test the null hypothesis that `mean
     (X) == M'.

     Hotelling's T^2 is returned in TSQ.  Under the null, (n-p) T^2 /
     (p(n-1)) has an F distribution with p and n-p degrees of freedom,
     where n and p are the numbers of samples and variables,
     respectively.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, TSQ] = hotelling_test_2 (X, Y)
     For two samples X from multivariate normal distributions with the
     same number of variables (columns), unknown means and unknown
     equal covariance matrices, test the null hypothesis `mean (X) ==
     mean (Y)'.

     Hotelling's two-sample T^2 is returned in TSQ.  Under the null,

          (n_x+n_y-p-1) T^2 / (p(n_x+n_y-2))

     where n_x and n_y are the sample sizes and p is the number of
     variables.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, KS] = kolmogorov_smirnov_test (X, DIST,
          PARAMS, ALT)
     Perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the null hypothesis that the
     sample X comes from the (continuous) distribution dist.  I.e., if
     F and G are the CDFs corresponding to the sample and dist,
     respectively, then the null is that F == G.

     The optional argument PARAMS contains a list of parameters of
     DIST.  For example, to test whether a sample X comes from a
     uniform distribution on [2,4], use

          kolmogorov_smirnov_test(x, "uniform", 2, 4)

     DIST can be any string for which a function DIST_CDF that
     calculates the CDF of distribution DIST exists.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative F != G.  In this case, the test
     statistic KS follows a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.
     If ALT is `">"', the one-sided alternative F > G is considered.
     Similarly for `"<"', the one-sided alternative F > G is
     considered.  In this case, the test statistic KS has a one-sided
     Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.  The default is the two-sided
     case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, KS, D] = kolmogorov_smirnov_test_2 (X, Y, ALT)
     Perform a 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the null hypothesis
     that the samples X and Y come from the same (continuous)
     distribution.  I.e., if F and G are the CDFs corresponding to the
     X and Y samples, respectively, then the null is that F == G.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative F != G.  In this case, the test
     statistic KS follows a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.
     If ALT is `">"', the one-sided alternative F > G is considered.
     Similarly for `"<"', the one-sided alternative F < G is
     considered.  In this case, the test statistic KS has a one-sided
     Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.  The default is the two-sided
     case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     The third returned value, D, is the test statistic, the maximum
     vertical distance between the two cumulative distribution
     functions.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, K, DF] = kruskal_wallis_test (X1, ...)
     Perform a Kruskal-Wallis one-factor "analysis of variance".

     Suppose a variable is observed for K > 1 different groups, and let
     X1, ..., XK be the corresponding data vectors.

     Under the null hypothesis that the ranks in the pooled sample are
     not affected by the group memberships, the test statistic K is
     approximately chi-square with DF = K - 1 degrees of freedom.

     If the data contains ties (some value appears more than once) K is
     divided by

     1 - SUM_TIES / (N^3 - N)

     where SUM_TIES is the sum of T^2 - T over each group of ties where
     T is the number of ties in the group and N is the total number of
     values in the input data.  For more info on this adjustment see
     "Use of Ranks in One-Criterion Variance Analysis" in Journal of
     the American Statistical Association, Vol. 47, No. 260 (Dec 1952)
     by William H. Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at K) is
     returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- Function File:  manova (Y, G)
     Perform a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).  The
     goal is to test whether the p-dimensional population means of data
     taken from K different groups are all equal.  All data are assumed
     drawn independently from p-dimensional normal distributions with
     the same covariance matrix.

     The data matrix is given by Y.  As usual, rows are observations
     and columns are variables.  The vector G specifies the
     corresponding group labels (e.g., numbers from 1 to K).

     the test statistic Z approximately follows a standard normal
     distribution.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative P1 != P2.  If ALT is `">"', the
     one-sided alternative P1 > P2 is used.  Similarly for `"<"', the
     one-sided alternative P1 < P2 is used.  The default is the

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, B, N] = sign_test (X, Y, ALT)
     For two matched-pair samples X and Y, perform a sign test of the
     null hypothesis PROB (X > Y) == PROB (X < Y) == 1/2.  Under the
     null, the test statistic B roughly follows a binomial distribution
     with parameters `N = sum (X != Y)' and P = 1/2.

     With the optional argument `alt', the alternative of interest can
     be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null hypothesis is
     tested against the two-sided alternative PROB (X < Y) != 1/2.  If
     ALT is `">"', the one-sided alternative PROB (X > Y) > 1/2 ("x is
     stochastically greater than y") is considered.  Similarly for
     `"<"', the one-sided alternative PROB (X > Y) < 1/2 ("x is
     stochastically less than y") is considered.  The default is the
     two-sided case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, T, DF] = t_test (X, M, ALT)
     For a sample X from a normal distribution with unknown mean and
     variance, perform a t-test of the null hypothesis `mean (X) == M'.
     Under the null, the test statistic T follows a Student
     distribution with `DF = length (X) - 1' degrees of freedom.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative `mean (X) != M'.  If ALT is
     `">"', the one-sided alternative `mean (X) > M' is considered.
     Similarly for "<", the one-sided alternative `mean (X) < M' is
     considered.  The default is the two-sided case.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, T, DF] = t_test_2 (X, Y, ALT)
     For two samples x and y from normal distributions with unknown
     means and unknown equal variances, perform a two-sample t-test of
     the null hypothesis of equal means.  Under the null, the test
     statistic T follows a Student distribution with DF degrees of
     freedom.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative `mean (X) != mean (Y)'.  If ALT
     is `">"', the one-sided alternative `mean (X) > mean (Y)' is used.
     Similarly for `"<"', the one-sided alternative `mean (X) < mean
     (Y)' is used.  The default is the two-sided case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, T, DF] = t_test_regression (Y, X, RR, R, ALT)
     Perform an t test for the null hypothesis `RR * B = R' in a
     classical normal regression model `Y = X * B + E'.  Under the
     null, the test statistic T follows a T distribution with DF
     degrees of freedom.

     If R is omitted, a value of 0 is assumed.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative `RR * B != R'.  If ALT is `">"',
     the one-sided alternative `RR * B > R' is used.  Similarly for
     "<", the one-sided alternative `RR * B < R' is used.  The default
     is the two-sided case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, Z] = u_test (X, Y, ALT)
     For two samples X and Y, perform a Mann-Whitney U-test of the null
     hypothesis PROB (X > Y) == 1/2 == PROB (X < Y).  Under the null,
     the test statistic Z approximately follows a standard normal
     distribution.  Note that this test is equivalent to the Wilcoxon
     rank-sum test.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative PROB (X > Y) != 1/2.  If ALT is
     `">"', the one-sided alternative PROB (X > Y) > 1/2 is considered.
     Similarly for `"<"', the one-sided alternative PROB (X > Y) < 1/2
     is considered.  The default is the two-sided case.

     For two samples X and Y from normal distributions with unknown
     means and unknown variances, perform an F-test of the null
     hypothesis of equal variances.  Under the null, the test statistic
     F follows an F-distribution with DF_NUM and DF_DEN degrees of
     freedom.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative `var (X) != var (Y)'.  If ALT is
     `">"', the one-sided alternative `var (X) > var (Y)' is used.
     Similarly for "<", the one-sided alternative `var (X) > var (Y)'
     is used.  The default is the two-sided case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 -- Function File: [PVAL, T, DF] = welch_test (X, Y, ALT)
     For two samples X and Y from normal distributions with unknown
     means and unknown and not necessarily equal variances, perform a
     Welch test of the null hypothesis of equal means.  Under the null,
     the test statistic T approximately follows a Student distribution
     with DF degrees of freedom.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest

     Under the null, the test statistic Z approximately follows a
     standard normal distribution when N > 25.

     *Warning*: This function assumes a normal distribution for Z and
     thus is invalid for N <= 25.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative PROB (X > Y) != 1/2.  If alt is

     hypothesis of equal means.  Under the null, the test statistic Z
     follows a standard normal distribution.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is `"!="' or `"<>"', the null is tested

25.5 Models
===========

 -- Function File: [THETA, BETA, DEV, DL, D2L, P] = logistic_regression
          (Y, X, PRINT, THETA, BETA)
     Perform ordinal logistic regression.

     Suppose Y takes values in K ordered categories, and let `gamma_i
     (X)' be the cumulative probability that Y falls in one of the
     first I categories given the covariate X.  Then

          [theta, beta] = logistic_regression (y, x)

     fits the model

          logit (gamma_i (x)) = theta_i - beta' * x,   i = 1 ... k-1

     The number of ordinal categories, K, is taken to be the number of
     distinct values of `round (Y)'.  If K equals 2, Y is binary and
     the model is ordinary logistic regression.  The matrix X is
     assumed to have full column rank.

     Given Y only, `theta = logistic_regression (y)' fits the model
     with baseline logit odds only.

     The full form is

          [theta, beta, dev, dl, d2l, gamma]
             = logistic_regression (y, x, print, theta, beta)

     in which all output arguments and all input arguments except Y are
     optional.

     Setting PRINT to 1 requests summary information about the fitted
     model to be displayed.  Setting PRINT to 2 requests information
     about convergence at each iteration.  Other values request no
     information to be displayed.  The input arguments THETA and BETA
     give initial estimates for THETA and BETA.

     The returned value DEV holds minus twice the log-likelihood.

     The returned values DL and D2L are the vector of first and the
     matrix of second derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to
     THETA and BETA.

     P holds estimates for the conditional distribution of Y given X.

26 Sets
*******

Octave has a limited number of functions for managing sets of data,
where a set is defined as a collection of unique elements.  In Octave a
set is represented as a vector of numbers.

 -- Function File:  unique (X)
 -- Function File:  unique (X, "rows")
 -- Function File:  unique (..., "first")
 -- Function File:  unique (..., "last")
 -- Function File: [Y, I, J] = unique (...)
     Return the unique elements of X, sorted in ascending order.  If X
     is a row vector, return a row vector, but if X is a column vector
     or a matrix return a column vector.

     If the optional argument `"rows"' is supplied, return the unique
     rows of X, sorted in ascending order.

     If requested, return index vectors I and J such that `x(i)==y' and
     `y(j)==x'.

     Additionally, one of `"first"' or `"last"' may be given as an
     argument.  If `"last"' is specified, return the highest possible
     indices in I, otherwise, if `"first"' is specified, return the
     lowest.  The default is `"last"'.

26.1 Set Operations
===================

Octave supports the basic set operations.  That is, Octave can compute
the union, intersection, complement, and difference of two sets.
Octave also supports the _Exclusive Or_ set operation, and membership
determination.  The functions for set operations all work in pretty
much the same way.  As an example, assume that `x' and `y' contains two
sets, then

     union(x, y)

computes the union of the two sets.

     `A(i,j)' is in S and 0 if it is not.  If a second output argument
     is requested, the index into S of each of the matching elements is
     also returned.

     of the matrices A and B will be considered an element of sets.

27 Polynomial Manipulations
***************************

In Octave, a polynomial is represented by its coefficients (arranged in
descending order).  For example, a vector C of length N+1 corresponds
to the following polynomial of order  N

     p(x) = C(1) x^N + ... + C(N) x + C(N+1).

File: octave.info,  Node: Evaluating Polynomials,  Next: Finding Roots,  Up: Polynomial Manipulations

27.1 Evaluating Polynomials
===========================

The value of a polynomial represented by the vector C can be evaluated
at the point X very easily, as the following example shows:

     N = length(c)-1;
     val = dot( x.^(N:-1:0), c );

While the above example shows how easy it is to compute the value of a
polynomial, it isn't the most stable algorithm.  With larger polynomials
you should use more elegant algorithms, such as Horner's Method, which
is exactly what the Octave function `polyval' does.

   In the case where X is a square matrix, the polynomial given by C is
still well-defined.  As when X is a scalar the obvious implementation
is easily expressed in Octave, but also in this case more elegant
algorithms perform better.  The `polyvalm' function provides such an
algorithm.

 -- Function File: Y = polyval (P, X)
 -- Function File: Y = polyval (P, X, [], MU)
     Evaluate the polynomial at of the specified values for X.  When MU
     is present evaluate the polynomial for (X-MU(1))/MU(2).  If X is a
     vector or matrix, the polynomial is evaluated for each of the
     elements of X.

 -- Function File: [Y, DY] = polyval (P, X, S)
 -- Function File: [Y, DY] = polyval (P, X, S, MU)
     In addition to evaluating the polynomial, the second output
     represents the prediction interval, Y +/- DY, which contains at
     least 50% of the future predictions.  To calculate the prediction
     interval, the structured variable S, originating form `polyfit',
     must be present.

 -- Function File:  polyvalm (C, X)
     Evaluate a polynomial in the matrix sense.

     `polyvalm (C, X)' will evaluate the polynomial in the matrix
     sense, i.e., matrix multiplication is used instead of element by
     element multiplication as is used in polyval.

     The argument X must be a square matrix.

27.2 Finding Roots
==================

Octave can find the roots of a given polynomial.  This is done by
computing the companion matrix of the polynomial (see the `compan'
function for a definition), and then finding its eigenvalues.

 -- Function File:  roots (V)
     For a vector V with N components, return the roots of the
     polynomial

          v(1) * z^(N-1) + ... + v(N-1) * z + v(N)

     As an example, the following code finds the roots of the quadratic
     polynomial
          p(x) = x^2 - 5.

          c = [1, 0, -5];
          roots(c)
          =>  2.2361
          => -2.2361
     Note that the true result is +/- sqrt(5) which is roughly +/-
     2.2361.

     *See also:* *note compan: doc-compan.

 -- Function File:  compan (C)
     Compute the companion matrix corresponding to polynomial
     coefficient vector C.

     The companion matrix is

               _                                                        _
              |  -c(2)/c(1)   -c(3)/c(1)  ...  -c(N)/c(1)  -c(N+1)/c(1)  |
              |       1            0      ...       0             0      |
              |       0            1      ...       0             0      |
          A = |       .            .   .            .             .      |
              |       .            .       .        .             .      |
              |       .            .           .    .             .      |
              |_      0            0      ...       1             0     _|

     The eigenvalues of the companion matrix are equal to the roots of
     the polynomial.

     ordering them from largest to smallest.

     If the relative difference of the poles is less than TOL, then
     they are considered to be multiples.  The default value for TOL is
     0.001.

     If the optional parameter REORDER is zero, poles are not sorted.

     The value MULTP is a vector specifying the multiplicity of the
     poles.  MULTP(:) refers to multiplicity of P(INDX(:)).

     For example,

          p = [2 3 1 1 2];
          [m, n] = mpoles(p);
            => m = [1; 1; 2; 1; 2]
            => n = [2; 5; 1; 4; 3]
            => p(n) = [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]

27.3 Products of Polynomials
============================

 -- Function File:  conv (A, B)
     Convolve two vectors.

     `y = conv (a, b)' returns a vector of length equal to `length (a)
     + length (b) - 1'.  If A and B are polynomial coefficient vectors,
     `conv' returns the coefficients of the product polynomial.

     *See also:* *note deconv: doc-deconv, *note poly: doc-poly, *note
     roots: doc-roots, *note residue: doc-residue, *note polyval:
     doc-polyval, *note polyderiv: doc-polyderiv, *note polyinteg:
     doc-polyinteg.

 -- Function File: C = convn (A, B, SHAPE)
     N-dimensional convolution of matrices A and B.

     The size of the output is determined by the SHAPE argument.  This
     can be any of the following character strings:

    "full"
          The full convolution result is returned.  The size out of the
          output is `size (A) + size (B)-1'.  This is the default
          behavior.

    "same"
          The central part of the convolution result is returned.  The
          size out of the output is the same as A.

    "valid"
          The valid part of the convolution is returned.  The size of
          the result is `max (size (A) - size (B)+1, 0)'.

     *See also:* *note conv: doc-conv, *note conv2: doc-conv2.

 -- Function File:  deconv (Y, A)
     Deconvolve two vectors.

     `[b, r] = deconv (y, a)' solves for B and R such that `y = conv
     (a, b) + r'.

     If Y and A are polynomial coefficient vectors, B will contain the
     coefficients of the polynomial quotient and R will be a remainder
     polynomial of lowest order.

     *See also:* *note conv: doc-conv, *note poly: doc-poly, *note

     doc-polyinteg.

 -- Loadable Function: y = conv2 (A, B, SHAPE)
 -- Loadable Function: y = conv2 (V1, V2, M, SHAPE)
     Returns 2D convolution of A and B where the size of C is given by

    SHAPE= 'full'
          returns full 2-D convolution

    SHAPE= 'same'
          same size as a. 'central' part of convolution

    SHAPE= 'valid'
          only parts which do not include zero-padded edges

     By default SHAPE is 'full'.  When the third argument is a matrix
     returns the convolution of the matrix M by the vector V1 in the
     column direction and by vector V2 in the row direction

 -- Function File: Q = polygcd (B, A, TOL)
     Find greatest common divisor of two polynomials.  This is
     equivalent to the polynomial found by multiplying together all the
     common roots.  Together with deconv, you can reduce a ratio of two
     polynomials.  Tolerance defaults to
          sqrt(eps).
      Note that this is an unstable algorithm, so don't try it on large
     polynomials.

     Example
          polygcd (poly(1:8), poly(3:12)) - poly(3:8)
          => [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
          deconv (poly(1:8), polygcd (poly(1:8), poly(3:12))) ...
            - poly(1:2)
          => [ 0, 0, 0 ]

 -- Function File: [R, P, K, E] = residue (B, A)
     Compute the partial fraction expansion for the quotient of the
     polynomials, B and A.

           B(s)    M       r(m)         N
           ---- = SUM -------------  + SUM k(i)*s^(N-i)
           A(s)   m=1 (s-p(m))^e(m)    i=1

     where M is the number of poles (the length of the R, P, and E),
     the K vector is a polynomial of order N-1 representing the direct
     contribution, and the E vector specifies the multiplicity of the
     m-th residue's pole.

     For example,

          b = [1, 1, 1];
          a = [1, -5, 8, -4];
          [r, p, k, e] = residue (b, a);
               => r = [-2; 7; 3]
               => p = [2; 2; 1]
               => k = [](0x0)
               => e = [1; 2; 1]

     which represents the following partial fraction expansion

                  s^2 + s + 1       -2        7        3
             ------------------- = ----- + ------- + -----
             s^3 - 5s^2 + 8s - 4   (s-2)   (s-2)^2   (s-1)

 -- Function File: [B, A] = residue (R, P, K)
 -- Function File: [B, A] = residue (R, P, K, E)
     Compute the reconstituted quotient of polynomials, B(s)/A(s), from
     the partial fraction expansion; represented by the residues,
     poles, and a direct polynomial specified by R, P and K, and the
     pole multiplicity E.

     If the multiplicity, E, is not explicitly specified the
     multiplicity is determined by the script mpoles.m.

     For example,

          r = [-2; 7; 3];
          p = [2; 2; 1];
          k = [1, 0];
          [b, a] = residue (r, p, k);
               => b = [1, -5, 9, -3, 1]
               => a = [1, -5, 8, -4]

          where mpoles.m is used to determine e = [1; 2; 1]

     Alternatively the multiplicity may be defined explicitly, for
     example,

          r = [7; 3; -2];
          p = [2; 1; 2];
          k = [1, 0];
          e = [2; 1; 1];
          [b, a] = residue (r, p, k, e);
               => b = [1, -5, 9, -3, 1]
               => a = [1, -5, 8, -4]

     which represents the following partial fraction expansion

              -2        7        3         s^4 - 5s^3 + 9s^2 - 3s + 1
             ----- + ------- + ----- + s = --------------------------
             (s-2)   (s-2)^2   (s-1)          s^3 - 5s^2 + 8s - 4

27.4 Derivatives and Integrals
==============================

Octave comes with functions for computing the derivative and the
integral of a polynomial.  The functions `polyderiv' and `polyint' both
return new polynomials describing the result.  As an example we'll
compute the definite integral of p(x) = x^2 + 1 from 0 to 3.

     c = [1, 0, 1];
     integral = polyint(c);
     area = polyval(integral, 3) - polyval(integral, 0)
     => 12

 -- Function File:  polyderiv (C)
 -- Function File: [Q] = polyderiv (B, A)
 -- Function File: [Q, R] = polyderiv (B, A)
     Return the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial whose
     coefficients are given by vector C.  If a pair of polynomials is
     given B and A, the derivative of the product is returned in Q, or
     the quotient numerator in Q and the quotient denominator in R.

     coefficients are represented by the vector C.

     The constant of integration is set to zero.

27.5 Polynomial Interpolation
=============================

Octave comes with good support for various kinds of interpolation, most
of which are described in *note Interpolation::.  One simple alternative
to the functions described in the aforementioned chapter, is to fit a
single polynomial to some given data points.  To avoid a highly
fluctuating polynomial, one most often wants to fit a low-order
polynomial to data.  This usually means that it is necessary to fit the
polynomial in a least-squares sense, which is what the `polyfit'
function does.

 -- Function File: [P, S, MU] = polyfit (X, Y, N)
     Return the coefficients of a polynomial P(X) of degree N that
     minimizes the least-squares-error of the fit.

     The polynomial coefficients are returned in a row vector.

     The second output is a structure containing the following fields:

    `R'
          Triangular factor R from the QR decomposition.

    `X'
          The Vandermonde matrix used to compute the polynomial
          coefficients.

    `df'
          The degrees of freedom.

    `normr'
          The norm of the residuals.

    `yf'
          The values of the polynomial for each value of X.

     The second output may be used by `polyval' to calculate the
     statistical error limits of the predicted values.

     When the third output, MU, is present the coefficients, P, are
     associated with a polynomial in XHAT = (X-MU(1))/MU(2).  Where
     MU(1) = mean (X), and MU(2) = std (X).  This linear transformation
     of X improves the numerical stability of the fit.

     *See also:* *note polyval: doc-polyval, *note residue: doc-residue.

   In situations where a single polynomial isn't good enough, a solution
is to use several polynomials pieced together.  The function `mkpp'
creates a piece-wise polynomial, `ppval' evaluates the function created
by `mkpp', and `unmkpp' returns detailed information about the function.

   The following example shows how to combine two linear functions and a
quadratic into one function.  Each of these functions is expressed on
adjoined intervals.

     x = [-2, -1, 1, 2];
     p = [ 0,  1, 0;
           1, -2, 1;
           0, -1, 1 ];
     pp = mkpp(x, p);
     xi = linspace(-2, 2, 50);
     yi = ppval(pp, xi);
     plot(xi, yi);

 -- Function File: YI = ppval (PP, XI)
     Evaluate piece-wise polynomial PP at the points XI.  If `PP.d' is
     a scalar greater than 1, or an array, then the returned value YI
     will be an array that is `d1, d1, ..., dk, length (XI)]'.

     *See also:* *note mkpp: doc-mkpp, *note unmkpp: doc-unmkpp, *note
     spline: doc-spline.

 -- Function File: PP = mkpp (X, P)
 -- Function File: PP = mkpp (X, P, D)
     Construct a piece-wise polynomial structure from sample points X
     and coefficients P.  The i-th row of P, `P (I,:)', contains the
     coefficients for the polynomial over the I-th interval, ordered
     from highest to lowest.  There must be one row for each interval
     in X, so `rows (P) == length (X) - 1'.

     You can concatenate multiple polynomials of the same order over the
     same set of intervals using `P = [ P1; P2; ...; PD ]'.  In this
     case, `rows (P) == D * (length (X) - 1)'.

     D specifies the shape of the matrix P for all except the last
     dimension.  If D is not specified it will be computed as `round
     (rows (P) / (length (X) - 1))' instead.

     *See also:* *note unmkpp: doc-unmkpp, *note ppval: doc-ppval,
     *note spline: doc-spline.

 -- Function File: [X, P, N, K, D] = unmkpp (PP)
     Extract the components of a piece-wise polynomial structure PP.
     These are as follows:

    X
          Sample points.

    P
          Polynomial coefficients for points in sample interval.  `P
          (I, :)' contains the coefficients for the polynomial over
          interval I ordered from highest to lowest.  If `D > 1', `P
          (R, I, :)' contains the coefficients for the r-th polynomial
          defined on interval I.  However, this is stored as a 2-D
          array such that `C = reshape (P (:, J), N, D)' gives `C (I,
          R)' is the j-th coefficient of the r-th polynomial over the
          i-th interval.

    N
          Number of polynomial pieces.

    K
          Order of the polynomial plus 1.

    D
          Number of polynomials defined for each interval.

27.6 Miscellaneous Functions
============================

 -- Function File:  poly (A)
     If A is a square N-by-N matrix, `poly (A)' is the row vector of
     the coefficients of `det (z * eye (N) - a)', the characteristic
     polynomial of A.  As an example we can use this to find the
     eigenvalues of A as the roots of `poly (A)'.
          roots(poly(eye(3)))
          => 1.00000 + 0.00000i
          => 1.00000 - 0.00000i
          => 1.00000 + 0.00000i
     In real-life examples you should, however, use the `eig' function
     for computing eigenvalues.

     If X is a vector, `poly (X)' is a vector of coefficients of the
     polynomial whose roots are the elements of X.  That is, of C is a
     polynomial, then the elements of `D = roots (poly (C))' are
     contained in C.  The vectors C and D are, however, not equal due
     to sorting and numerical errors.

     *See also:* *note eig: doc-eig, *note roots: doc-roots.

 -- Function File:  polyout (C, X)
     Write formatted polynomial
             c(x) = c(1) * x^n + ... + c(n) x + c(n+1)
      and return it as a string or write it to the screen (if NARGOUT
     is zero).  X defaults to the string `"s"'.

28.1 One-dimensional Interpolation
==================================

Octave supports several methods for one-dimensional interpolation, most
of which are described in this section.  *note Polynomial
Interpolation:: and *note Interpolation on Scattered Data:: describe
further methods.

 -- Function File: YI = interp1 (X, Y, XI)
 -- Function File: YI = interp1 (..., METHOD)
 -- Function File: YI = interp1 (..., EXTRAP)
 -- Function File: PP = interp1 (..., 'pp')
     One-dimensional interpolation.  Interpolate Y, defined at the
     points X, at the points XI.  The sample points X must be strictly
     monotonic.  If Y is an array, treat the columns of Y separately.

     Method is one of:

    'nearest'
          Return the nearest neighbor.

    'linear'
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors

    'pchip'
          Piece-wise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial

    'cubic'
          Cubic interpolation from four nearest neighbors

    'spline'
          Cubic spline interpolation-smooth first and second derivatives
          throughout the curve

     Appending '*' to the start of the above method forces `interp1' to
     assume that X is uniformly spaced, and only `X (1)' and `X (2)'
     are referenced.  This is usually faster, and is never slower.  The
     default method is 'linear'.

     If EXTRAP is the string 'extrap', then extrapolate values beyond
     the endpoints.  If EXTRAP is a number, replace values beyond the
     endpoints with that number.  If EXTRAP is missing, assume NA.

     If the string argument 'pp' is specified, then XI should not be
     supplied and `interp1' returns the piece-wise polynomial that can
     later be used with `ppval' to evaluate the interpolation.  There
     is an equivalence, such that `ppval (interp1 (X, Y, METHOD, 'pp'),
     XI) == interp1 (X, Y, XI, METHOD, 'extrap')'.

     An example of the use of `interp1' is

          xf = [0:0.05:10];
          yf = sin (2*pi*xf/5);
          xp = [0:10];
          yp = sin (2*pi*xp/5);
          lin = interp1 (xp, yp, xf);
          spl = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "spline");
          cub = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "cubic");
          near = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "nearest");
          plot (xf, yf, "r", xf, lin, "g", xf, spl, "b",
                xf, cub, "c", xf, near, "m", xp, yp, "r*");
          legend ("original", "linear", "spline", "cubic", "nearest")

     *See also:* *note interpft: doc-interpft.

   There are some important differences between the various
interpolation methods.  The 'spline' method enforces that both the
first and second derivatives of the interpolated values have a
continuous derivative, whereas the other methods do not.  This means
that the results of the 'spline' method are generally smoother.  If the
function to be interpolated is in fact smooth, then 'spline' will give
excellent results.  However, if the function to be evaluated is in some
manner discontinuous, then 'pchip' interpolation might give better
results.

   This can be demonstrated by the code

     t = -2:2;
     dt = 1;
     ti =-2:0.025:2;
     dti = 0.025;
     y = sign(t);
     ys = interp1(t,y,ti,'spline');
     yp = interp1(t,y,ti,'pchip');
     ddys = diff(diff(ys)./dti)./dti;
     ddyp = diff(diff(yp)./dti)./dti;
     figure(1);
     plot (ti, ys,'r-', ti, yp,'g-');
     legend('spline','pchip',4);
     figure(2);
     plot (ti, ddys,'r+', ti, ddyp,'g*');
     legend('spline','pchip');

   A simplified version of `interp1' that performs only linear
interpolation is available in `interp1q'.  This argument is slightly
faster than `interp1' as to performs little error checking.

 -- Function File: YI = interp1q (X, Y, XI)
     One-dimensional linear interpolation without error checking.
     Interpolates Y, defined at the points X, at the points XI.  The
     sample points X must be a strictly monotonically increasing column
     vector.  If Y is an array, treat the columns of Y separately.  If
     Y is a vector, it must be a column vector of the same length as X.

     Values of XI beyond the endpoints of the interpolation result in
     NA being returned.

     Note that the error checking is only a significant portion of the
     execution time of this `interp1' if the size of the input arguments
     is relatively small.  Therefore, the benefit of using `interp1q'
     is relatively small.

     *See also:* *note interp1: doc-interp1.

   Fourier interpolation, is a resampling technique where a signal is
converted to the frequency domain, padded with zeros and then
reconverted to the time domain.

 -- Function File:  interpft (X, N)
 -- Function File:  interpft (X, N, DIM)
     Fourier interpolation.  If X is a vector, then X is resampled with
     N points.  The data in X is assumed to be equispaced.  If X is an
     array, then operate along each column of the array separately.  If
     DIM is specified, then interpolate along the dimension DIM.

     `interpft' assumes that the interpolated function is periodic, and
     so assumptions are made about the end points of the interpolation.

     *See also:* *note interp1: doc-interp1.

   There are two significant limitations on Fourier interpolation.
Firstly, the function signal is assumed to be periodic, and so
non-periodic signals will be poorly represented at the edges.
Secondly, both the signal and its interpolation are required to be
sampled at equispaced points.  An example of the use of `interpft' is

     t = 0 : 0.3 : pi; dt = t(2)-t(1);
     n = length (t); k = 100;
     ti = t(1) + [0 : k-1]*dt*n/k;
     y = sin (4*t + 0.3) .* cos (3*t - 0.1);
     yp = sin (4*ti + 0.3) .* cos (3*ti - 0.1);
     plot (ti, yp, 'g', ti, interp1(t, y, ti, 'spline'), 'b', ...
           ti, interpft (y, k), 'c', t, y, 'r+');
     legend ('sin(4t+0.3)cos(3t-0.1','spline','interpft','data');

which demonstrates the poor behavior of Fourier interpolation for
non-periodic functions.

   In additional the support function `spline' and `lookup' that
underlie the `interp1' function can be called directly.

 -- Function File: PP = spline (X, Y)
 -- Function File: YI = spline (X, Y, XI)
     Return the cubic spline interpolant of Y at points X.  If called
     with two arguments, `spline' returns the piece-wise polynomial PP
     that may later be used with `ppval' to evaluate the polynomial at
     specific points.  If called with a third input argument, `spline'
     evaluates the spline at the points XI.  There is an equivalence
     between `ppval (spline (X, Y), XI)' and `spline (X, Y, XI)'.

     The variable X must be a vector of length N, and Y can be either a
     vector or array.  In the case where Y is a vector, it can have a
     length of either N or `N + 2'.  If the length of Y is N, then the
     'not-a-knot' end condition is used.  If the length of Y is `N + 2',
     then the first and last values of the vector Y are the values of
     the first derivative of the cubic spline at the end-points.

     If Y is an array, then the size of Y must have the form `[S1, S2,
     ..., SK, N]' or `[S1, S2, ..., SK, N + 2]'.  The array is then
     reshaped internally to a matrix where the leading dimension is
     given by `S1 * S2 * ... * SK' and each row of this matrix is then
     treated separately.  Note that this is exactly the opposite
     treatment than `interp1' and is done for compatibility.

     *See also:* *note ppval: doc-ppval, *note mkpp: doc-mkpp, *note
     unmkpp: doc-unmkpp.

   The `lookup' function is used by other interpolation functions to
identify the points of the original data that are closest to the
current point of interest.

 -- Loadable Function: IDX = lookup (TABLE, Y, OPT)
     Lookup values in a sorted table.  Usually used as a prelude to
     interpolation.

     If table is strictly increasing and `idx = lookup (table, y)', then
     `table(idx(i)) <= y(i) < table(idx(i+1))' for all `y(i)' within
     the table.  If `y(i) < table (1)' then `idx(i)' is 0. If `y(i) >=
     table(end)' then `idx(i)' is `table(n)'.

     If the table is strictly decreasing, then the tests are reversed.
     There are no guarantees for tables which are non-monotonic or are
     not strictly monotonic.

     The algorithm used by lookup is standard binary search, with
     optimizations to speed up the case of partially ordered arrays
     (dense downsampling).  In particular, looking up a single entry is
     of logarithmic complexity (unless a conversion occurs due to
     non-numeric or unequal types).

     TABLE and Y can also be cell arrays of strings (or Y can be a
     single string).  In this case, string lookup is performed using
     lexicographical comparison.

     If OPTS is specified, it shall be a string with letters indicating
     additional options.  For numeric lookup, 'l' in OPTS indicates that
     the leftmost subinterval shall be extended to infinity (i.e., all
     indices at least 1), and 'r' indicates that the rightmost
     subinterval shall be extended to infinity (i.e., all indices at
     most n-1).

     For string lookup, 'i' indicates case-insensitive comparison.

28.2 Multi-dimensional Interpolation
====================================

There are three multi-dimensional interpolation functions in Octave,
with similar capabilities.  Methods using Delaunay tessellation are
described in *note Interpolation on Scattered Data::.

 -- Function File: ZI = interp2 (X, Y, Z, XI, YI)
 -- Function File: ZI = interp2 (Z, XI, YI)
 -- Function File: ZI = interp2 (Z, N)
 -- Function File: ZI = interp2 (..., METHOD)
 -- Function File: ZI = interp2 (..., METHOD, EXTRAPVAL)
     Two-dimensional interpolation.  X, Y and Z describe a surface
     function.  If X and Y are vectors their length must correspondent
     to the size of Z.  X and Y must be monotonic.  If they are
     matrices they must have the `meshgrid' format.

    `interp2 (X, Y, Z, XI, YI, ...)'
          Returns a matrix corresponding to the points described by the
          matrices XI, YI.

          If the last argument is a string, the interpolation method can
          be specified.  The method can be 'linear', 'nearest' or
          'cubic'.  If it is omitted 'linear' interpolation is assumed.

    `interp2 (Z, XI, YI)'
          Assumes `X = 1:rows (Z)' and `Y = 1:columns (Z)'

    `interp2 (Z, N)'
          Interleaves the matrix Z n-times.  If N is omitted a value of
          `N = 1' is assumed.

     The variable METHOD defines the method to use for the
     interpolation.  It can take one of the following values

    'nearest'
          Return the nearest neighbor.

    'linear'
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

    'pchip'
          Piece-wise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial (not
          implemented yet).

    'cubic'
          Cubic interpolation from four nearest neighbors.

    'spline'
          Cubic spline interpolation-smooth first and second derivatives
          throughout the curve.

     If a scalar value EXTRAPVAL is defined as the final value, then
     values outside the mesh as set to this value.  Note that in this
     case METHOD must be defined as well.  If EXTRAPVAL is not defined
     then NA is assumed.

     *See also:* *note interp1: doc-interp1.

 -- Function File: VI = interp3 (X, Y,Z, V, XI, YI, ZI)
 -- Function File: VI = interp3 (V, XI, YI, ZI)
 -- Function File: VI = interp3 (V, M)
 -- Function File: VI = interp3 (V)
 -- Function File: VI = interp3 (..., METHOD)
 -- Function File: VI = interp3 (..., METHOD, EXTRAPVAL)
     Perform 3-dimensional interpolation.  Each element of the
     3-dimensional array V represents a value at a location given by
     the parameters X, Y, and Z.  The parameters X, X, and Z are either
     3-dimensional arrays of the same size as the array V in the
     'meshgrid' format or vectors.  The parameters XI, etc.  respect a
     similar format to X, etc., and they represent the points at which
     the array VI is interpolated.

     If X, Y, Z are omitted, they are assumed to be `x = 1 : size (V,
     2)', `y = 1 : size (V, 1)' and `z = 1 : size (V, 3)'.  If M is
     specified, then the interpolation adds a point half way between
     each of the interpolation points.  This process is performed M
     times.  If only V is specified, then M is assumed to be `1'.

     Method is one of:

    'nearest'
          Return the nearest neighbor.

    'linear'
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

    'cubic'
          Cubic interpolation from four nearest neighbors (not
          implemented yet).

    'spline'
          Cubic spline interpolation-smooth first and second derivatives
          throughout the curve.

     The default method is 'linear'.

     If EXTRAP is the string 'extrap', then extrapolate values beyond
     the endpoints.  If EXTRAP is a number, replace values beyond the
     endpoints with that number.  If EXTRAP is missing, assume NA.

     *See also:* *note interp1: doc-interp1, *note interp2:
     doc-interp2, *note spline: doc-spline, *note meshgrid:
     doc-meshgrid.

 -- Function File: VI = interpn (X1, X2, ..., V, Y1, Y2, ...)
 -- Function File: VI = interpn (V, Y1, Y2, ...)
 -- Function File: VI = interpn (V, M)
 -- Function File: VI = interpn (V)
 -- Function File: VI = interpn (..., METHOD)
 -- Function File: VI = interpn (..., METHOD, EXTRAPVAL)
     Perform N-dimensional interpolation, where N is at least two.
     Each element of the N-dimensional array V represents a value at a
     location given by the parameters X1, X2, ..., XN.  The parameters
     X1, X2, ..., XN are either N-dimensional arrays of the same size
     as the array V in the 'ndgrid' format or vectors.  The parameters
     Y1, etc. respect a similar format to X1, etc., and they represent
     the points at which the array VI is interpolated.

     If X1, ..., XN are omitted, they are assumed to be `x1 = 1 : size
     (V, 1)', etc.  If M is specified, then the interpolation adds a
     point half way between each of the interpolation points.  This
     process is performed M times.  If only V is specified, then M is
     assumed to be `1'.

     Method is one of:

    'nearest'
          Return the nearest neighbor.

    'linear'
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

    'cubic'
          Cubic interpolation from four nearest neighbors (not
          implemented yet).

    'spline'
          Cubic spline interpolation-smooth first and second derivatives
          throughout the curve.

     The default method is 'linear'.

     If EXTRAPVAL is the scalar value, use it to replace the values
     beyond the endpoints with that number.  If EXTRAPVAL is missing,
     assume NA.

     *See also:* *note interp1: doc-interp1, *note interp2:
     doc-interp2, *note spline: doc-spline, *note ndgrid: doc-ndgrid.

   A significant difference between `interpn' and the other two
multidimensional interpolation functions is the fashion in which the
dimensions are treated.  For `interp2' and `interp3', the 'y' axis is
considered to be the columns of the matrix, whereas the 'x' axis
corresponds to the rows of the array.  As Octave indexes arrays in
column major order, the first dimension of any array is the columns, and
so `interpn' effectively reverses the 'x' and 'y' dimensions.  Consider
the example

     x = y = z = -1:1;
     f = @(x,y,z) x.^2 - y - z.^2;
     [xx, yy, zz] = meshgrid (x, y, z);
     v = f (xx,yy,zz);
     xi = yi = zi = -1:0.1:1;
     [xxi, yyi, zzi] = meshgrid (xi, yi, zi);
     vi = interp3(x, y, z, v, xxi, yyi, zzi, 'spline');
     [xxi, yyi, zzi] = ndgrid (xi, yi, zi);
     vi2 = interpn(x, y, z, v, xxi, yyi, zzi, 'spline');
     mesh (zi, yi, squeeze (vi2(1,:,:)));

where `vi' and `vi2' are identical.  The reversal of the dimensions is
treated in the `meshgrid' and `ndgrid' functions respectively.

   In additional the support function `bicubic' that underlies the
cubic interpolation of `interp2' function can be called directly.

 -- Function File: ZI = bicubic (X, Y, Z, XI, YI, EXTRAPVAL)
     Return a matrix ZI corresponding to the bicubic interpolations at
     XI and YI of the data supplied as X, Y and Z.  Points outside the
     grid are set to EXTRAPVAL.

     See `http://wiki.woodpecker.org.cn/moin/Octave/Bicubic' for
     further information.

29.1 Delaunay Triangulation
===========================

The Delaunay triangulation is constructed from a set of circum-circles.
These circum-circles are chosen so that there are at least three of the
points in the set to triangulation on the circumference of the
circum-circle.  None of the points in the set of points falls within
any of the circum-circles.

   In general there are only three points on the circumference of any
circum-circle.  However, in some cases, and in particular for the case
of a regular grid, 4 or more points can be on a single circum-circle.
In this case the Delaunay triangulation is not unique.

 -- Function File: TRI = delaunay (X, Y)
 -- Function File: TRI = delaunay (X, Y, OPT)
     The return matrix of size [n, 3] contains a set triangles which are
     described by the indices to the data point x and y vector.  The
     triangulation satisfies the Delaunay circum-circle criterion.  No
     other data point is in the circum-circle of the defining triangle.

     A third optional argument, which must be a string, contains extra
     options passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the
     documentation for the Qhull library for details.

          x = rand (1, 10);
          y = rand (size (x));
          T = delaunay (x, y);
          X = [x(T(:,1)); x(T(:,2)); x(T(:,3)); x(T(:,1))];
          Y = [y(T(:,1)); y(T(:,2)); y(T(:,3)); y(T(:,1))];
          axis ([0,1,0,1]);
          plot (X, Y, "b", x, y, "r*");

     *See also:* *note voronoi: doc-voronoi, *note delaunay3:
     doc-delaunay3, *note delaunayn: doc-delaunayn.

   The 3- and N-dimensional extension of the Delaunay triangulation are
given by `delaunay3' and `delaunayn' respectively.  `delaunay3' returns
a set of tetrahedra that satisfy the Delaunay circum-circle criteria.
Similarly, `delaunayn' returns the N-dimensional simplex satisfying the
Delaunay circum-circle criteria.  The N-dimensional extension of a
triangulation is called a tessellation.

 -- Function File: T = delaunay3 (X, Y, Z)
 -- Function File: T = delaunay3 (X, Y, Z, OPT)
     A matrix of size [n, 4] is returned.  Each row contains a set of
     tetrahedron which are described by the indices to the data point
     vectors (x,y,z).

     A fourth optional argument, which must be a string or cell array
     of strings, contains extra options passed to the underlying qhull
     command.  See the documentation for the Qhull library for details.

     *See also:* *note delaunay: doc-delaunay, *note delaunayn:
     doc-delaunayn.

 -- Function File: T = delaunayn (P)
 -- Function File: T = delaunayn (P, OPT)
     Form the Delaunay triangulation for a set of points.  The Delaunay
     triangulation is a tessellation of the convex hull of the points
     such that no n-sphere defined by the n-triangles contains any
     other points from the set.  The input matrix P of size `[n, dim]'
     contains N points in a space of dimension dim.  The return matrix
     T has the size `[m, dim+1]'.  It contains for each row a set of
     indices to the points, which describes a simplex of dimension dim.
     For example, a 2d simplex is a triangle and 3d simplex is a
     tetrahedron.

     Extra options for the underlying Qhull command can be specified by
     the second argument.  This argument is a cell array of strings.
     The default options depend on the dimension of the input:

        * 2D and 3D: OPT = `{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc"}'

        * 4D and higher: OPT = `{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc", "Qz"}'

     If OPT is [], then the default arguments are used.  If OPT is
     `{""}', then none of the default arguments are used by Qhull.  See
     the Qhull documentation for the available options.

     All options can also be specified as single string, for example
     `"Qt Qbb Qc Qz"'.


   An example of a Delaunay triangulation of a set of points is

     rand ("state", 2);
     x = rand (10, 1);
     y = rand (10, 1);
     T = delaunay (x, y);
     X = [ x(T(:,1)); x(T(:,2)); x(T(:,3)); x(T(:,1)) ];
     Y = [ y(T(:,1)); y(T(:,2)); y(T(:,3)); y(T(:,1)) ];
     axis ([0, 1, 0, 1]);
     plot(X, Y, "b", x, y, "r*");

29.1.1 Plotting the Triangulation
---------------------------------

Octave has the functions `triplot' and `trimesh' to plot the Delaunay
triangulation of a 2-dimensional set of points.

 -- Function File:  triplot (TRI, X, Y)
 -- Function File:  triplot (TRI, X, Y, LINESPEC)
 -- Function File: H = triplot (...)
     Plot a triangular mesh in 2D.  The variable TRI is the triangular
     meshing of the points `(X, Y)' which is returned from `delaunay'.
     If given, the LINESPEC determines the properties to use for the
     lines.  The output argument H is the graphic handle to the plot.

     *See also:* *note plot: doc-plot, *note trimesh: doc-trimesh,
     *note delaunay: doc-delaunay.

 -- Function File:  trimesh (TRI, X, Y, Z)
 -- Function File: H = trimesh (...)
     Plot a triangular mesh in 3D.  The variable TRI is the triangular
     meshing of the points `(X, Y)' which is returned from `delaunay'.
     The variable Z is value at the point `(X, Y)'.  The output
     argument H is the graphic handle to the plot.

     *See also:* *note triplot: doc-triplot, *note delaunay3:
     doc-delaunay3.

   The difference between `triplot' and `trimesh' is that the former
only plots the 2-dimensional triangulation itself, whereas the second
plots the value of some function `f (X, Y)'.  An example of the use of
the `triplot' function is

     rand ("state", 2)
     x = rand (20, 1);
     y = rand (20, 1);
     tri = delaunay (x, y);
     triplot (tri, x, y);

   that plot the Delaunay triangulation of a set of random points in
2-dimensions.

29.1.2 Identifying points in Triangulation
------------------------------------------

It is often necessary to identify whether a particular point in the
N-dimensional space is within the Delaunay tessellation of a set of
points in this N-dimensional space, and if so which N-simplex contains
the point and which point in the tessellation is closest to the desired
point.  The functions `tsearch' and `dsearch' perform this function in
a triangulation, and `tsearchn' and `dsearchn' in an N-dimensional
tessellation.

   To identify whether a particular point represented by a vector P
falls within one of the simplices of an N-simplex, we can write the
Cartesian coordinates of the point in a parametric form with respect to
the N-simplex.  This parametric form is called the Barycentric
Coordinates of the point.  If the points defining the N-simplex are
given by `N + 1' vectors T(I,:), then the Barycentric coordinates
defining the point P are given by

     P = sum (BETA(1:N+1) * T(1:N+1),:)

where there are `N + 1' values `BETA(I)' that together as a vector
represent the Barycentric coordinates of the point P.  To ensure a
unique solution for the values of `BETA(I)' an additional criteria of

     sum (BETA(1:N+1)) == 1

is imposed, and we can therefore write the above as

     P - T(end, :) = BETA(1:end-1) * (T(1:end-1, :)
           - ones(N, 1) * T(end, :)

Solving for BETA we can then write

     BETA(1:end-1) = (P - T(end, :)) / (T(1:end-1, :)
           - ones(N, 1) * T(end, :))
     BETA(end) = sum(BETA(1:end-1))

which gives the formula for the conversion of the Cartesian coordinates
of the point P to the Barycentric coordinates BETA.  An important
property of the Barycentric coordinates is that for all points in the
N-simplex

     0 <= BETA(I) <= 1

Therefore, the test in `tsearch' and `tsearchn' essentially only needs
to express each point in terms of the Barycentric coordinates of each
of the simplices of the N-simplex and test the values of BETA.  This is
exactly the implementation used in `tsearchn'.  `tsearch' is optimized
for 2-dimensions and the Barycentric coordinates are not explicitly
formed.

 -- Loadable Function: IDX = tsearch (X, Y, T, XI, YI)
     Searches for the enclosing Delaunay convex hull.  For `T =
     delaunay (X, Y)', finds the index in T containing the points `(XI,
     YI)'.  For points outside the convex hull, IDX is NaN.

     *See also:* *note delaunay: doc-delaunay, *note delaunayn:
     doc-delaunayn.

 -- Function File: [IDX, P] = tsearchn (X, T, XI)
     Searches for the enclosing Delaunay convex hull.  For `T =
     delaunayn (X)', finds the index in T containing the points XI.
     For points outside the convex hull, IDX is NaN.  If requested
     `tsearchn' also returns the Barycentric coordinates P of the
     enclosing triangles.

     *See also:* *note delaunay: doc-delaunay, *note delaunayn:
     doc-delaunayn.

   An example of the use of `tsearch' can be seen with the simple
triangulation

     X = [-1; -1; 1; 1];
     Y = [-1; 1; -1; 1];
     TRI = [1, 2, 3; 2, 3, 1];

consisting of two triangles defined by TRI.  We can then identify which
triangle a point falls in like

     tsearch (X, Y, TRI, -0.5, -0.5)
     => 1
     tsearch (X, Y, TRI, 0.5, 0.5)
     => 2

and we can confirm that a point doesn't lie within one of the triangles
like

     tsearch (X, Y, TRI, 2, 2)
     => NaN

   The `dsearch' and `dsearchn' find the closest point in a
tessellation to the desired point.  The desired point does not
necessarily have to be in the tessellation, and even if it the returned
point of the tessellation does not have to be one of the vertexes of the
N-simplex within which the desired point is found.

 -- Function File: IDX = dsearch (X, Y, TRI, XI, YI)
 -- Function File: IDX = dsearch (X, Y, TRI, XI, YI, S)
     Returns the index IDX or the closest point in `X, Y' to the
     elements `[XI(:), YI(:)]'.  The variable S is accepted but ignored
     for compatibility.

     Returns the index IDX or the closest point in X to the elements
     XI.  If OUTVAL is supplied, then the values of XI that are not
     contained within one of the simplicies TRI are set to OUTVAL.
     Generally, TRI is returned from `delaunayn (X)'.

     *See also:* *note dsearch: doc-dsearch, *note tsearch: doc-tsearch.

   An example of the use of `dsearch', using the above values of X, Y
and TRI is

     dsearch (X, Y, TRI, -2, -2)
     => 1

   If you wish the points that are outside the tessellation to be
flagged, then `dsearchn' can be used as

     dsearchn ([X, Y], TRI, [-2, -2], NaN)
     => NaN
     dsearchn ([X, Y], TRI, [-0.5, -0.5], NaN)
     => 1

where the point outside the tessellation are then flagged with `NaN'.

29.2 Voronoi Diagrams
=====================

A Voronoi diagram or Voronoi tessellation of a set of points S in an
N-dimensional space, is the tessellation of the N-dimensional space
such that all points in `V(P)', a partitions of the tessellation where
P is a member of S, are closer to P than any other point in S.  The
Voronoi diagram is related to the Delaunay triangulation of a set of
points, in that the vertexes of the Voronoi tessellation are the
centers of the circum-circles of the simplicies of the Delaunay
tessellation.

 -- Function File:  voronoi (X, Y)
 -- Function File:  voronoi (X, Y, "plotstyle")
 -- Function File:  voronoi (X, Y, "plotstyle", OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: [VX, VY] = voronoi (...)
     plots voronoi diagram of points `(X, Y)'.  The voronoi facets with
     points at infinity are not drawn.  [VX, VY] = voronoi(...) returns
     the vertices instead of plotting the diagram. plot (VX, VY) shows
     the voronoi diagram.

     A fourth optional argument, which must be a string, contains extra
     options passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the
     documentation for the Qhull library for details.

            x = rand (10, 1);
            y = rand (size (x));
            h = convhull (x, y);
            [vx, vy] = voronoi (x, y);
            plot (vx, vy, "-b", x, y, "o", x(h), y(h), "-g")
            legend ("", "points", "hull");

     *See also:* *note voronoin: doc-voronoin, *note delaunay:
     doc-delaunay, *note convhull: doc-convhull.

 -- Function File: [C, F] = voronoin (PTS)
 -- Function File: [C, F] = voronoin (PTS, OPTIONS)
     computes n- dimensional voronoi facets.  The input matrix PTS of
     size [n, dim] contains n points of dimension dim.  C contains the
     points of the voronoi facets.  The list F contains for each facet
     the indices of the voronoi points.

     A second optional argument, which must be a string, contains extra
     options passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the
     documentation for the Qhull library for details.

     *See also:* *note voronoin: doc-voronoin, *note delaunay:
     doc-delaunay, *note convhull: doc-convhull.

   An example of the use of `voronoi' is

     rand("state",9);
     x = rand(10,1);
     y = rand(10,1);
     tri = delaunay (x, y);
     [vx, vy] = voronoi (x, y, tri);
     triplot (tri, x, y, "b");
     hold on;
     plot (vx, vy, "r");

   Additional information about the size of the facets of a Voronoi
diagram, and which points of a set of points is in a polygon can be had
with the `polyarea' and `inpolygon' functions respectively.

 -- Function File:  polyarea (X, Y)
 -- Function File:  polyarea (X, Y, DIM)
     Determines area of a polygon by triangle method.  The variables X
     and Y define the vertex pairs, and must therefore have the same
     shape.  They can be either vectors or arrays.  If they are arrays
     then the columns of X and Y are treated separately and an area
     returned for each.

     If the optional DIM argument is given, then `polyarea' works along
     this dimension of the arrays X and Y.


   An example of the use of `polyarea' might be

     rand ("state", 2);
     x = rand (10, 1);
     y = rand (10, 1);
     [c, f] = voronoin ([x, y]);
     af = zeros (size(f));
     for i = 1 : length (f)
       af(i) = polyarea (c (f {i, :}, 1), c (f {i, :}, 2));
     endfor

   Facets of the Voronoi diagram with a vertex at infinity have infinity
area.  A simplified version of `polyarea' for rectangles is available
with `rectint'

 -- Function File: AREA = rectint (A, B)
     Compute the area of intersection of rectangles in A and rectangles
     in B.  Rectangles are defined as [x y width height] where x and y
     are the minimum values of the two orthogonal dimensions.

     If A or B are matrices, then the output, AREA, is a matrix where
     the i-th row corresponds to the i-th row of a and the j-th column
     corresponds to the j-th row of b.

     *See also:* *note polyarea: doc-polyarea.

 -- Function File: [IN, ON] = inpolygon (X, Y, XV, XY)
     For a polygon defined by `(XV, YV)' points, determine if the
     points `(X, Y)' are inside or outside the polygon.  The variables
     X, Y, must have the same dimension.  The optional output ON gives
     the points that are on the polygon.


   An example of the use of `inpolygon' might be

     randn ("state", 2);
     x = randn (100, 1);
     y = randn (100, 1);
     vx = cos (pi * [-1 : 0.1: 1]);
     vy = sin (pi * [-1 : 0.1 : 1]);
     in = inpolygon (x, y, vx, vy);
     plot(vx, vy, x(in), y(in), "r+", x(!in), y(!in), "bo");
     axis ([-2, 2, -2, 2]);

29.3 Convex Hull
================

The convex hull of a set of points is the minimum convex envelope
containing all of the points.  Octave has the functions `convhull' and
`convhulln' to calculate the convex hull of 2-dimensional and
N-dimensional sets of points.

 -- Function File: H = convhull (X, Y)
 -- Function File: H = convhull (X, Y, OPT)
     Returns the index vector to the points of the enclosing convex
     hull.  The data points are defined by the x and y vectors.

     A third optional argument, which must be a string, contains extra
     options passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the
     documentation for the Qhull library for details.

     *See also:* *note delaunay: doc-delaunay, *note convhulln:
     doc-convhulln.

 -- Loadable Function: H = convhulln (P)
 -- Loadable Function: H = convhulln (P, OPT)
 -- Loadable Function: [H, V] = convhulln (...)
     Return an index vector to the points of the enclosing convex hull.
     The input matrix of size [n, dim] contains n points of dimension
     dim.

     If a second optional argument is given, it must be a string or
     cell array of strings containing options for the underlying qhull
     command.  (See the Qhull documentation for the available options.)
     The default options are "s Qci Tcv".  If the second output V is
     requested the volume of the convex hull is calculated.

     *See also:* *note convhull: doc-convhull, *note delaunayn:
     doc-delaunayn.

   An example of the use of `convhull' is

     x = -3:0.05:3;
     y = abs (sin (x));
     k = convhull (x, y);
     plot (x(k), y(k), "r-", x, y, "b+");
     axis ([-3.05, 3.05, -0.05, 1.05]);

29.4 Interpolation on Scattered Data
====================================

An important use of the Delaunay tessellation is that it can be used to
interpolate from scattered data to an arbitrary set of points.  To do
this the N-simplex of the known set of points is calculated with
`delaunay', `delaunay3' or `delaunayn'.  Then the simplicies in to
which the desired points are found are identified.  Finally the
vertices of the simplicies are used to interpolate to the desired
points.  The functions that perform this interpolation are `griddata',
`griddata3' and `griddatan'.

 -- Function File: ZI = griddata (X, Y, Z, XI, YI, METHOD)
 -- Function File: [XI, YI, ZI] = griddata (X, Y, Z, XI, YI, METHOD)
     Generate a regular mesh from irregular data using interpolation.
     The function is defined by `Z = f (X, Y)'.  The interpolation
     points are all `(XI, YI)'.  If XI, YI are vectors then they are
     made into a 2D mesh.

     The interpolation method can be `"nearest"', `"cubic"' or
     `"linear"'.  If method is omitted it defaults to `"linear"'.

     *See also:* *note delaunay: doc-delaunay.

 -- Function File: VI = griddata3 (X, Y, Z, V XI, YI, ZI, METHOD,
          OPTIONS)
     Generate a regular mesh from irregular data using interpolation.
     The function is defined by `Y = f (X,Y,Z)'.  The interpolation
     points are all XI.

     The interpolation method can be `"nearest"' or `"linear"'.  If
     method is omitted it defaults to `"linear"'.

     *See also:* *note griddata: doc-griddata, *note delaunayn:
     doc-delaunayn.

 -- Function File: YI = griddatan (X, Y, XI, METHOD, OPTIONS)
     Generate a regular mesh from irregular data using interpolation.
     The function is defined by `Y = f (X)'.  The interpolation points
     are all XI.

     The interpolation method can be `"nearest"' or `"linear"'.  If
     method is omitted it defaults to `"linear"'.

     *See also:* *note griddata: doc-griddata, *note delaunayn:
     doc-delaunayn.

   An example of the use of the `griddata' function is

     rand("state",1);
     x=2*rand(1000,1)-1;
     y=2*rand(size(x))-1;
     z=sin(2*(x.^2+y.^2));
     [xx,yy]=meshgrid(linspace(-1,1,32));
     griddata(x,y,z,xx,yy);

that interpolates from a random scattering of points, to a uniform grid.

30 Signal Processing
********************

This chapter describes the signal processing and fast Fourier transform
functions available in Octave.  Fast Fourier transforms are computed
with the FFTW or FFTPACK libraries depending on how Octave is built.

 -- Function File:  detrend (X, P)
     If X is a vector, `detrend (X, P)' removes the best fit of a
     polynomial of order P from the data X.

     If X is a matrix, `detrend (X, P)' does the same for each column
     in X.

     The second argument is optional.  If it is not specified, a value
     of 1 is assumed.  This corresponds to removing a linear trend.

 -- Loadable Function:  fft (A, N, DIM)
     Compute the FFT of A using subroutines from FFTW.  The FFT is
     calculated along the first non-singleton dimension of the array.
     Thus if A is a matrix, `fft (A)' computes the FFT for each column
     of A.

     If called with two arguments, N is expected to be an integer
     specifying the number of elements of A to use, or an empty matrix
     to specify that its value should be ignored.  If N is larger than
     the dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then A is resized
     and padded with zeros.  Otherwise, if N is smaller than the
     dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then A is truncated.

     If called with three arguments, DIM is an integer specifying the
     dimension of the matrix along which the FFT is performed

     *See also:* *note ifft: doc-ifft, *note fft2: doc-fft2, *note
     fftn: doc-fftn, *note fftw: doc-fftw.

   Octave uses the FFTW libraries to perform FFT computations.  When
Octave starts up and initializes the FFTW libraries, they read a system
wide file (on a Unix system, it is typically `/etc/fftw/wisdom') that
contains information useful to speed up FFT computations.  This
information is called the _wisdom_.  The system-wide file allows wisdom
to be shared between all applications using the FFTW libraries.

   Use the `fftw' function to generate and save wisdom.  Using the
utilities provided together with the FFTW libraries (`fftw-wisdom' on
Unix systems), you can even add wisdom generated by Octave to the
system-wide wisdom file.

 -- Loadable Function: METHOD = fftw ('planner')
 -- Loadable Function:  fftw ('planner', METHOD)
 -- Loadable Function: WISDOM = fftw ('dwisdom')
 -- Loadable Function: WISDOM = fftw ('dwisdom', WISDOM)
     Manage FFTW wisdom data.  Wisdom data can be used to significantly
     accelerate the calculation of the FFTs but implies an initial cost
     in its calculation.  When the FFTW libraries are initialized, they
     read a system wide wisdom file (typically in `/etc/fftw/wisdom'),
     allowing wisdom to be shared between applications other than
     Octave.  Alternatively, the `fftw' function can be used to import
     wisdom.  For example

          WISDOM = fftw ('dwisdom')

     will save the existing wisdom used by Octave to the string WISDOM.
     This string can then be saved to a file and restored using the
     `save' and `load' commands respectively.  This existing wisdom can
     be reimported as follows

          fftw ('dwisdom', WISDOM)

     If WISDOM is an empty matrix, then the wisdom used is cleared.

     During the calculation of Fourier transforms further wisdom is
     generated.  The fashion in which this wisdom is generated is
     equally controlled by the `fftw' function.  There are five
     different manners in which the wisdom can be treated, these being

    'estimate'
          This specifies that no run-time measurement of the optimal
          means of calculating a particular is performed, and a simple
          heuristic is used to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan.  The
          advantage of this method is that there is little or no
          overhead in the generation of the plan, which is appropriate
          for a Fourier transform that will be calculated once.

    'measure'
          In this case a range of algorithms to perform the transform
          is considered and the best is selected based on their
          execution time.

    'patient'
          This is like 'measure', but a wider range of algorithms is
          considered.

    'exhaustive'
          This is like 'measure', but all possible algorithms that may
          be used to treat the transform are considered.

    'hybrid'
          As run-time measurement of the algorithm can be expensive,
          this is a compromise where 'measure' is used for transforms
          up to the size of 8192 and beyond that the 'estimate' method
          is used.

     The default method is 'estimate', and the method currently being
     used can be probed with

          METHOD = fftw ('planner')

     and the method used can be set using

          fftw ('planner', METHOD)

     Note that calculated wisdom will be lost when restarting Octave.
     However, the wisdom data can be reloaded if it is saved to a file
     as described above.  Saved wisdom files should not be used on
     different platforms since they will not be efficient and the point
     of calculating the wisdom is lost.

 -- Loadable Function:  ifft (A, N, DIM)
     Compute the inverse FFT of A using subroutines from FFTW.  The
     inverse FFT is calculated along the first non-singleton dimension
     of the array.  Thus if A is a matrix, `fft (A)' computes the
     inverse FFT for each column of A.

     If called with two arguments, N is expected to be an integer
     specifying the number of elements of A to use, or an empty matrix
     to specify that its value should be ignored.  If N is larger than
     the dimension along which the inverse FFT is calculated, then A is
     resized and padded with zeros.  Otherwise, ifN is smaller than the
     dimension along which the inverse FFT is calculated, then A is
     truncated.

     If called with three arguments, DIM is an integer specifying the
     dimension of the matrix along which the inverse FFT is performed

     *See also:* *note fft: doc-fft, *note ifft2: doc-ifft2, *note
     ifftn: doc-ifftn, *note fftw: doc-fftw.

 -- Loadable Function:  fft2 (A, N, M)
     Compute the two-dimensional FFT of A using subroutines from FFTW.
     The optional arguments N and M may be used specify the number of
     rows and columns of A to use.  If either of these is larger than
     the size of A, A is resized and padded with zeros.

     If A is a multi-dimensional matrix, each two-dimensional sub-matrix
     of A is treated separately

     *See also:* ifft2, fft, fftn, fftw.

 -- Loadable Function:  fft2 (A, N, M)
     Compute the inverse two-dimensional FFT of A using subroutines from
     FFTW.  The optional arguments N and M may be used specify the
     number of rows and columns of A to use.  If either of these is
     larger than the size of A, A is resized and padded with zeros.

     If A is a multi-dimensional matrix, each two-dimensional sub-matrix
     of A is treated separately

     *See also:* fft2, ifft, ifftn, fftw.

 -- Loadable Function:  fftn (A, SIZE)
     Compute the N-dimensional FFT of A using subroutines from FFTW.
     The optional vector argument SIZE may be used specify the
     dimensions of the array to be used.  If an element of SIZE is
     smaller than the corresponding dimension, then the dimension is
     truncated prior to performing the FFT.  Otherwise if an element of
     SIZE is larger than the corresponding dimension A is resized and
     padded with zeros.

     *See also:* ifftn, fft, fft2, fftw.

 -- Loadable Function:  ifftn (A, SIZE)
     Compute the inverse N-dimensional FFT of A using subroutines from
     FFTW.  The optional vector argument SIZE may be used specify the
     dimensions of the array to be used.  If an element of SIZE is
     smaller than the corresponding dimension, then the dimension is
     truncated prior to performing the inverse FFT.  Otherwise if an
     element of SIZE is larger than the corresponding dimension A is
     resized and padded with zeros.

     *See also:* fftn, ifft, ifft2, fftw.

 -- Function File:  fftconv (A, B, N)
     Return the convolution of the vectors A and B, as a vector with
     length equal to the `length (a) + length (b) - 1'.  If A and B are
     the coefficient vectors of two polynomials, the returned value is
     the coefficient vector of the product polynomial.

     The computation uses the FFT by calling the function `fftfilt'.  If
     the optional argument N is specified, an N-point FFT is used.

 -- Function File:  fftfilt (B, X, N)
     With two arguments, `fftfilt' filters X with the FIR filter B
     using the FFT.

     Given the optional third argument, N, `fftfilt' uses the
     overlap-add method to filter X with B using an N-point FFT.

     If X is a matrix, filter each column of the matrix.

 -- Loadable Function: y = filter (B, A, X)
 -- Loadable Function: [Y, SF] = filter (B, A, X, SI)
 -- Loadable Function: [Y, SF] = filter (B, A, X, [], DIM)
 -- Loadable Function: [Y, SF] = filter (B, A, X, SI, DIM)
     Return the solution to the following linear, time-invariant
     difference equation:

             N                   M
            SUM a(k+1) y(n-k) = SUM b(k+1) x(n-k)      for 1<=n<=length(x)
            k=0                 k=0

     where  N=length(a)-1 and M=length(b)-1.  over the first
     non-singleton dimension of X or over DIM if supplied.  An
     equivalent form of this equation is:

                      N                   M
            y(n) = - SUM c(k+1) y(n-k) + SUM d(k+1) x(n-k)  for 1<=n<=length(x)
                     k=1                 k=0

     where  c = a/a(1) and d = b/a(1).

     If the fourth argument SI is provided, it is taken as the initial
     state of the system and the final state is returned as SF.  The
     state vector is a column vector whose length is equal to the
     length of the longest coefficient vector minus one.  If SI is not
     supplied, the initial state vector is set to all zeros.

     In terms of the z-transform, y is the result of passing the
     discrete- time signal x through a system characterized by the
     following rational system function:

                       M
                      SUM d(k+1) z^(-k)
                      k=0
            H(z) = ----------------------
                         N
                    1 + SUM c(k+1) z^(-k)
                        k=1

 -- Function File: Y = filter2 (B, X)
 -- Function File: Y = filter2 (B, X, SHAPE)
     Apply the 2-D FIR filter B to X.  If the argument SHAPE is
     specified, return an array of the desired shape.  Possible values
     are:

    'full'
          pad X with zeros on all sides before filtering.

    'same'
          unpadded X (default)

    'valid'
          trim X after filtering so edge effects are no included.

     Note this is just a variation on convolution, with the parameters
     reversed and B rotated 180 degrees.

     *See also:* *note conv2: doc-conv2.

 -- Function File: [H, W] = freqz (B, A, N, "whole")
     Return the complex frequency response H of the rational IIR filter
     whose numerator and denominator coefficients are B and A,
     respectively.  The response is evaluated at N angular frequencies
     between 0 and  2*pi.

     The output value W is a vector of the frequencies.

     If the fourth argument is omitted, the response is evaluated at
     frequencies between 0 and  pi.

     If N is omitted, a value of 512 is assumed.

     If A is omitted, the denominator is assumed to be 1 (this
     corresponds to a simple FIR filter).

     For fastest computation, N should factor into a small number of
     small primes.

 -- Function File: H = freqz (B, A, W)
     Evaluate the response at the specific frequencies in the vector W.
     The values for W are measured in radians.

 -- Function File: [...] = freqz (..., FS)
     Return frequencies in Hz instead of radians assuming a sampling
     rate FS.  If you are evaluating the response at specific
     frequencies W, those frequencies should be requested in Hz rather
     than radians.

 -- Function File:  freqz (...)
     Plot the pass band, stop band and phase response of H rather than
     returning them.

 -- Function File:  freqz_plot (W, H)
     Plot the pass band, stop band and phase response of H.

 -- Function File:  sinc (X)
     Return  sin(pi*x)/(pi*x).

 -- Function File: B = unwrap (A, TOL, DIM)
     Unwrap radian phases by adding multiples of 2*pi as appropriate to
     remove jumps greater than TOL.  TOL defaults to pi.

     Unwrap will unwrap along the first non-singleton dimension of A,
     unless the optional argument DIM is given, in which case the data
     will be unwrapped along this dimension

 -- Function File: [A, B] = arch_fit (Y, X, P, ITER, GAMMA, A0, B0)
     Fit an ARCH regression model to the time series Y using the
     scoring algorithm in Engle's original ARCH paper.  The model is

          y(t) = b(1) * x(t,1) + ... + b(k) * x(t,k) + e(t),
          h(t) = a(1) + a(2) * e(t-1)^2 + ... + a(p+1) * e(t-p)^2

     in which e(t) is N(0, h(t)), given a time-series vector Y up to
     time t-1 and a matrix of (ordinary) regressors X up to t.  The
     order of the regression of the residual variance is specified by P.

     If invoked as `arch_fit (Y, K, P)' with a positive integer K, fit
     an ARCH(K, P) process, i.e., do the above with the t-th row of X
     given by

          [1, y(t-1), ..., y(t-k)]

     Optionally, one can specify the number of iterations ITER, the
     updating factor GAMMA, and initial values a0 and b0 for the
     scoring algorithm.

 -- Function File:  arch_rnd (A, B, T)
     Simulate an ARCH sequence of length T with AR coefficients B and
     CH coefficients A.  I.e., the result y(t) follows the model

          y(t) = b(1) + b(2) * y(t-1) + ... + b(lb) * y(t-lb+1) + e(t),

     where e(t), given Y up to time t-1, is N(0, h(t)), with

          h(t) = a(1) + a(2) * e(t-1)^2 + ... + a(la) * e(t-la+1)^2

 -- Function File: [PVAL, LM] = arch_test (Y, X, P)
     For a linear regression model

          y = x * b + e

     perform a Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test of the null hypothesis of
     no conditional heteroscedascity against the alternative of CH(P).

     I.e., the model is

          y(t) = b(1) * x(t,1) + ... + b(k) * x(t,k) + e(t),

     given Y up to t-1 and X up to t, e(t) is N(0, h(t)) with

          h(t) = v + a(1) * e(t-1)^2 + ... + a(p) * e(t-p)^2,

     and the null is a(1) == ... == a(p) == 0.

     If the second argument is a scalar integer, k, perform the same
     test in a linear autoregression model of order k, i.e., with

          [1, y(t-1), ..., y(t-K)]

     as the t-th row of X.

     Under the null, LM approximately has a chisquare distribution with
     P degrees of freedom and PVAL is the p-value (1 minus the CDF of
     this distribution at LM) of the test.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

 -- Function File:  arma_rnd (A, B, V, T, N)
     Return a simulation of the ARMA model

          x(n) = a(1) * x(n-1) + ... + a(k) * x(n-k)
               + e(n) + b(1) * e(n-1) + ... + b(l) * e(n-l)

     in which K is the length of vector A, L is the length of vector B
     and E is Gaussian white noise with variance V.  The function
     returns a vector of length T.

     The optional parameter N gives the number of dummy X(I) used for
     initialization, i.e., a sequence of length T+N is generated and
     X(N+1:T+N) is returned.  If N is omitted, N = 100 is used.

 -- Function File:  autocor (X, H)
     Return the autocorrelations from lag 0 to H of vector X.  If H is
     omitted, all autocorrelations are computed.  If X is a matrix, the
     autocorrelations of each column are computed.

 -- Function File:  autocov (X, H)
     Return the autocovariances from lag 0 to H of vector X.  If H is
     omitted, all autocovariances are computed.  If X is a matrix, the
     autocovariances of each column are computed.

 -- Function File:  autoreg_matrix (Y, K)
     Given a time series (vector) Y, return a matrix with ones in the
     first column and the first K lagged values of Y in the other
     columns.  I.e., for T > K, `[1, Y(T-1), ..., Y(T-K)]' is the t-th
     row of the result.  The resulting matrix may be used as a
     regressor matrix in autoregressions.

 -- Function File:  bartlett (M)
     Return the filter coefficients of a Bartlett (triangular) window of
     length M.

     For a definition of the Bartlett window, see e.g., A. V. Oppenheim
     & R. W. Schafer, `Discrete-Time Signal Processing'.

 -- Function File:  blackman (M)
     Return the filter coefficients of a Blackman window of length M.

     For a definition of the Blackman window, see e.g., A. V. Oppenheim
     & R. W. Schafer, `Discrete-Time Signal Processing'.

 -- Function File: [D, DD] = diffpara (X, A, B)
     Return the estimator D for the differencing parameter of an
     integrated time series.

     The frequencies from [2*pi*a/t, 2*pi*b/T] are used for the
     estimation.  If B is omitted, the interval [2*pi/T, 2*pi*a/T] is
     used.  If both B and A are omitted then a = 0.5 * sqrt (T) and b =
     1.5 * sqrt (T) is used, where T is the sample size.  If X is a
     matrix, the differencing parameter of each column is estimated.

     The estimators for all frequencies in the intervals described
     above is returned in DD.  The value of D is simply the mean of DD.

 -- Function File:  durbinlevinson (C, OLDPHI, OLDV)
     Perform one step of the Durbin-Levinson algorithm.

     The vector C specifies the autocovariances `[gamma_0, ...,
     gamma_t]' from lag 0 to T, OLDPHI specifies the coefficients based
     on C(T-1) and OLDV specifies the corresponding error.

     If OLDPHI and OLDV are omitted, all steps from 1 to T of the
     algorithm are performed.

 -- Function File:  fftshift (V)
 -- Function File:  fftshift (V, DIM)
     Perform a shift of the vector V, for use with the `fft' and `ifft'
     functions, in order the move the frequency 0 to the center of the
     vector or matrix.

     If V is a vector of N elements corresponding to N time samples
     spaced of Dt each, then `fftshift (fft (V))' corresponds to
     frequencies

          f = ((1:N) - ceil(N/2)) / N / Dt

     If V is a matrix, the same holds for rows and columns.  If V is an
     array, then the same holds along each dimension.

     The optional DIM argument can be used to limit the dimension along
     which the permutation occurs.

 -- Function File:  ifftshift (V)
 -- Function File:  ifftshift (V, DIM)
     Undo the action of the `fftshift' function.  For even length V,
     `fftshift' is its own inverse, but odd lengths differ slightly.

 -- Function File:  fractdiff (X, D)
     Compute the fractional differences (1-L)^d x where L denotes the
     lag-operator and d is greater than -1.

 -- Function File:  hamming (M)
     Return the filter coefficients of a Hamming window of length M.

     For a definition of the Hamming window, see e.g., A. V. Oppenheim &
     R. W. Schafer, `Discrete-Time Signal Processing'.

 -- Function File:  hanning (M)
     Return the filter coefficients of a Hanning window of length M.

     For a definition of this window type, see e.g., A. V. Oppenheim &
     R. W. Schafer, `Discrete-Time Signal Processing'.

 -- Function File:  hurst (X)
     Estimate the Hurst parameter of sample X via the rescaled range
     statistic.  If X is a matrix, the parameter is estimated for every
     single column.

 -- Function File: PP = pchip (X, Y)
 -- Function File: YI = pchip (X, Y, XI)
     Piecewise Cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial.  Called with two
     arguments, the piece-wise polynomial PP is returned, that may
     later be used with `ppval' to evaluate the polynomial at specific
     points.

     The variable X must be a strictly monotonic vector (either
     increasing or decreasing).  While Y can be either a vector or
     array.  In the case where Y is a vector, it must have a length of
     N.  If Y is an array, then the size of Y must have the form `[S1,
     S2, ..., SK, N]' The array is then reshaped internally to a matrix
     where the leading dimension is given by `S1 * S2 * ... * SK' and
     each row in this matrix is then treated separately.  Note that this
     is exactly the opposite treatment than `interp1' and is done for
     compatibility.

     Called with a third input argument, `pchip' evaluates the
     piece-wise polynomial at the points XI.  There is an equivalence
     between `ppval (pchip (X, Y), XI)' and `pchip (X, Y, XI)'.

 -- Function File:  spectral_adf (C, WIN, B)
     Return the spectral density estimator given a vector of
     autocovariances C, window name WIN, and bandwidth, B.

     The window name, e.g., `"triangle"' or `"rectangle"' is used to
     search for a function called `WIN_sw'.

     If WIN is omitted, the triangle window is used.  If B is omitted,
     `1 / sqrt (length (X))' is used.

 -- Function File:  spectral_xdf (X, WIN, B)
     Return the spectral density estimator given a data vector X,
     window name WIN, and bandwidth, B.

     The window name, e.g., `"triangle"' or `"rectangle"' is used to
     search for a function called `WIN_sw'.

     If WIN is omitted, the triangle window is used.  If B is omitted,
     `1 / sqrt (length (X))' is used.

     Compute the short-time Fourier transform of the vector X with
     NUM_COEF coefficients by applying a window of WIN_SIZE data points
     and an increment of INC points.

     Before computing the Fourier transform, one of the following
     windows is applied:

    hanning
          w_type = 1

    hamming
          w_type = 2

    rectangle
          w_type = 3

     The window names can be passed as strings or by the W_TYPE number.

     If not all arguments are specified, the following defaults are
     used: WIN_SIZE = 80, INC = 24, NUM_COEF = 64, and W_TYPE = 1.

     `Y = stft (X, ...)' returns the absolute values of the Fourier
     coefficients according to the NUM_COEF positive frequencies.

     `[Y, C] = stft (`x', ...)' returns the entire STFT-matrix Y and a

31 Image Processing
*******************

Since an image basically is a matrix Octave is a very powerful
environment for processing and analyzing images.  To illustrate how
easy it is to do image processing in Octave, the following example will
load an image, smooth it by a 5-by-5 averaging filter, and compute the
gradient of the smoothed image.

     I = imread ("myimage.jpg");
     S = conv2 (I, ones (5, 5) / 25, "same");
     [Dx, Dy] = gradient (S);

In this example `S' contains the smoothed image, and `Dx' and `Dy'
contains the partial spatial derivatives of the image.

31.1 Loading and Saving Images
==============================

The first step in most image processing tasks is to load an image into
Octave.  This is done using the `imread' function, which uses the
`GraphicsMagick' library for reading.  This means a vast number of image
formats is supported.  The `imwrite' function is the corresponding
function for writing images to the disk.

   In summary, most image processing code will follow the structure of
this code

     I = imread ("my_input_image.img");
     J = process_my_image (I);
     imwrite ("my_output_image.img", J);

 -- Function File: [IMG, MAP, ALPHA] = imread (FILENAME)
     Read images from various file formats.

     The size and numeric class of the output depends on the format of
     the image.  A color image is returned as an MxNx3 matrix.
     Grey-level and black-and-white images are of size MxN.  The color
     depth of the image determines the numeric class of the output:
     "uint8" or "uint16" for grey and color, and "logical" for black
     and white.

     *See also:* *note imwrite: doc-imwrite, *note imfinfo: doc-imfinfo.

 -- Function File:  imwrite (IMG, FILENAME, FMT, P1, V1, ...)
 -- Function File:  imwrite (IMG, MAP, FILENAME, FMT, P1, V1, ...)
     Write images in various file formats.

     If FMT is missing, the file extension (if any) of FILENAME is used
     to determine the format.

     The parameter-value pairs (P1, V1, ...) are optional.  Currently
     the following options are supported for JPEG images

    `Quality'
          Sets the quality of the compression.  The corresponding value
          should be an integer between 0 and 100, with larger values
          meaning higher visual quality and less compression.

     *See also:* *note imread: doc-imread, *note imfinfo: doc-imfinfo.

 -- Built-in Function: VAL = IMAGE_PATH ()
 -- Built-in Function: OLD_VAL = IMAGE_PATH (NEW_VAL)
     Query or set the internal variable that specifies a colon separated
     list of directories in which to search for image files.

   It is possible to get information about an image file on disk,
without actually reading it into Octave.  This is done using the
`imfinfo' function which provides read access to many of the parameters
stored in the header of the image file.

 -- Function File: INFO = imfinfo (FILENAME)
 -- Function File: INFO = imfinfo (URL)
     Read image information from a file.

     `imfinfo' returns a structure containing information about the
     image stored in the file FILENAME.  The output structure contains
     the following fields.

    `Filename'
          The full name of the image file.

    `FileSize'
          Number of bytes of the image on disk

    `FileModDate'
          Date of last modification to the file.

    `Height'
          Image height in pixels.

    `Width'
          Image Width in pixels.

    `BitDepth'
          Number of bits per channel per pixel.

    `Format'
          Image format (e.g., `"jpeg"').

    `XResolution'
          X resolution of the image.

    `YResolution'
          Y resolution of the image.

    `TotalColors'
          Number of unique colors in the image.

    `TileName'
          Tile name.

    `AnimationDelay'
          Time in 1/100ths of a second (0 to 65535) which must expire
          before displaying the next image in an animated sequence.

    `AnimationIterations'
          Number of iterations to loop an animation (e.g., Netscape
          loop extension) for.

    `ByteOrder'
          Endian option for formats that support it.  Is either
          `"little-endian"', `"big-endian"', or `"undefined"'.

    `Gamma'
          Gamma level of the image.  The same color image displayed on
          two different workstations may look different due to
          differences in the display monitor.

    `Matte'
          `true' if the image has transparency.

    `ModulusDepth'
          Image modulus depth (minimum number of bits required to
          support red/green/blue components without loss of accuracy).

    `Quality'
          JPEG/MIFF/PNG compression level.

    `QuantizeColors'
          Preferred number of colors in the image.

          `"pixels per centimeter"', or `"undefined"'.

    `ColorType'
          Image type.  Is either `"grayscale"', `"indexed"',
          `"truecolor"', or `"undefined"'.

    `View'

31.2 Displaying Images
======================

A natural part of image processing is visualization of an image.  The
most basic function for this is the `imshow' function that shows the
image given in the first input argument.  This function uses an
external program to show the image.  If gnuplot 4.2 or later is
available it will be used to display the image, otherwise the
`display', `xv', or `xloadimage' program is used.  The actual program
can be selected with the `image_viewer' function.

 -- Function File:  imshow (IM)
 -- Function File:  imshow (IM, LIMITS)
 -- Function File:  imshow (IM, MAP)
 -- Function File:  imshow (RGB, ...)
 -- Function File:  imshow (FILENAME)
 -- Function File:  imshow (..., STRING_PARAM1, VALUE1, ...)
     Display the image IM, where IM can be a 2-dimensional (gray-scale
     image) or a 3-dimensional (RGB image) matrix.

     If LIMITS is a 2-element vector `[LOW, HIGH]', the image is shown
     using a display range between LOW and HIGH.  If an empty matrix is
     passed for LIMITS, the display range is computed as the range
     between the minimal and the maximal value in the image.

     If MAP is a valid color map, the image will be shown as an indexed
     image using the supplied color map.

     If a file name is given instead of an image, the file will be read
     and shown.

     If given, the parameter STRING_PARAM1 has value VALUE1.
     STRING_PARAM1 can be any of the following:
    `"displayrange"'
          VALUE1 is the display range as described above.

     *See also:* *note image: doc-image, *note imagesc: doc-imagesc,
     *note colormap: doc-colormap, *note gray2ind: doc-gray2ind, *note
     rgb2ind: doc-rgb2ind.

 -- Function File:  image (IMG)
 -- Function File:  image (X, Y, IMG)
     Display a matrix as a color image.  The elements of X are indices
     into the current colormap, and the colormap will be scaled so that
     the extremes of X are mapped to the extremes of the colormap.

     It first tries to use `gnuplot', then `display' from
     `ImageMagick', then `xv', and then `xloadimage'.  The actual
     program used can be changed using the `image_viewer' function.

     The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified
     in X and Y.  If you're not using gnuplot 4.2 or later, these
     variables are ignored.

     *See also:* *note imshow: doc-imshow, *note imagesc: doc-imagesc,
     *note colormap: doc-colormap, *note image_viewer: doc-image_viewer.

 -- Function File:  imagesc (A)
 -- Function File:  imagesc (X, Y, A)
 -- Function File:  imagesc (..., LIMITS)
 -- Function File:  imagesc (H, ...)
 -- Function File: H = imagesc (...)
     Display a scaled version of the matrix A as a color image.  The
     colormap is scaled so that the entries of the matrix occupy the
     entire colormap.  If LIMITS = [LO, HI] are given, then that range
     is set to the 'clim' of the current axes.

     The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified
     in X and Y, either as pairs giving the minimum and maximum values
     for the respective axes, or as values for each row and column of
     the matrix A.

     *See also:* *note image: doc-image, *note imshow: doc-imshow,
     *note caxis: doc-caxis.

 -- Function File: [FCN, DEFAULT_ZOOM] = image_viewer (FCN,
          DEFAULT_ZOOM)
     Change the program or function used for viewing images and return
     the previous values.

     When the `image' or `imshow' function is called it will launch an
     external program to display the image.  The default behavior is to
     use gnuplot if the installed version supports image viewing, and
     otherwise try the programs `display', `xv', and `xloadimage'.
     Using this function it is possible to change that behavior.

     When called with one input argument images will be displayed by
     saving the image to a file and the system command COMMAND will be
     called to view the image.  The COMMAND must be a string containing
     `%s' and possibly `%f'.  The `%s' will be replaced by the filename
     of the image, and the `%f' will (if present) be replaced by the
     zoom factor given to the `image' function.  For example,
          image_viewer ("eog %s");
     changes the image viewer to the `eog' program.

     With two input arguments, images will be displayed by calling the
     function FUNCTION_HANDLE.  For example,
          image_viewer (data, @my_image_viewer);
     sets the image viewer function to `my_image_viewer'.  The image
     viewer function is called with
          my_image_viewer (X, Y, IM, ZOOM, DATA)
     where X and Y are the axis of the image, IM is the image variable,
     and DATA is extra user-supplied data to be passed to the viewer
     function.

     With three input arguments it is possible to change the zooming.
     Some programs (like `xloadimage') require the zoom factor to be
     between 0 and 100, and not 0 and 1 like Octave assumes.  This is
     solved by setting the third argument to 100.

     *See also:* *note image: doc-image, *note imshow: doc-imshow.

31.3 Representing Images
========================

In general Octave supports four different kinds of images, gray-scale
images, RGB images, binary images, and indexed images.  A gray-scale
image is represented with an M-by-N matrix in which each element
corresponds to the intensity of a pixel.  An RGB image is represented
with an M-by-N-by-3 array where each 3-vector corresponds to the red,
green, and blue intensities of each pixel.

   The actual meaning of the value of a pixel in a gray-scale or RGB
image depends on the class of the matrix.  If the matrix is of class
`double' pixel intensities are between 0 and 1, if it is of class
`uint8' intensities are between 0 and 255, and if it is of class
`uint16' intensities are between 0 and 65535.

   A binary image is an M-by-N matrix of class `logical'.  A pixel in a
binary image is black if it is `false' and white if it is `true'.

   An indexed image consists of an M-by-N matrix of integers and a
C-by-3 color map.  Each integer corresponds to an index in the color
map, and each row in the color map corresponds to an RGB color.  The
color map must be of class `double' with values between 0 and 1.

 -- Function File: [IMG, MAP] = gray2ind (I, N)
     Convert a gray scale intensity image to an Octave indexed image.
     The indexed image will consist of N different intensity values.
     If not given N will default to 64.

 -- Function File:  ind2gray (X, MAP)
     Convert an Octave indexed image to a gray scale intensity image.
     If MAP is omitted, the current colormap is used to determine the
     intensities.

 -- Function File:  colormap (MAP)
 -- Function File:  colormap ("default")
     Set the current colormap.

     `colormap (MAP)' sets the current colormap to MAP.  The color map
     should be an N row by 3 column matrix.  The columns contain red,
     green, and blue intensities respectively.  All entries should be
     between 0 and 1 inclusive.  The new colormap is returned.

     `colormap ("default")' restores the default colormap (the `jet'
     map with 64 entries).  The default colormap is returned.

     With no arguments, `colormap' returns the current color map.

 -- Function File: MAP_OUT = brighten (MAP, BETA)
 -- Function File: MAP_OUT = brighten (H, BETA)
 -- Function File: MAP_OUT = brighten (BETA)
     Darkens or brightens the given colormap.  If the MAP argument is
     omitted, the function is applied to the current colormap.  The
     first argument can also be a valid graphics handle H, in which case
     `brighten' is applied to the colormap associated with this handle.

     Should the resulting colormap MAP_OUT not be assigned, it will be
     written to the current colormap.

     The argument BETA should be a scalar between -1 and 1, where a
     negative value darkens and a positive value brightens the colormap.

 -- Function File:  contrast (X, N)
     Return a gray colormap that maximizes the contrast in an image.
     The returned colormap will have N rows.  If N is not defined then
     the size of the current colormap is used instead.

     *See also:* *note colormap: doc-colormap.

   An additional colormap is `gmap40'.  This code map contains only
colors with integer values of the red, green and blue components.  This
is a workaround for a limitation of gnuplot 4.0, that does not allow
the color of line or patch objects to be set, and so `gmap40' is useful
for gnuplot 4.0 users, and in particular in conjunction with the BAR,
BARH or CONTOUR functions.

 -- Function File:  gmap40 (N)
     Create a color colormap.  The colormap is red, green, blue, yellow,
     magenta and cyan.  These are the colors that are allowed with patch
     objects using gnuplot 4.0, and so this colormap function is
     specially designed for users of gnuplot 4.0.  The argument N
     should be a scalar.  If it is omitted, a length of 6 is assumed.
     Larger values of N result in a repetition of the above colors

     *See also:* *note colormap: doc-colormap.

   You may use the `spinmap' function to cycle through the colors in
the current colormap, displaying the changes for the current figure.

 -- Function File:  spinmap (T, INC)
     Cycle the colormap for T seconds with an increment of INC.  Both
     parameters are optional.  The default cycle time is 5 seconds and
     the default increment is 2.

     A higher value of INC causes a faster cycle through the colormap.

31.4 Plotting on top of Images
==============================

If gnuplot is being used to display images it is possible to plot on
top of images.  Since an image is a matrix it is indexed by row and
column values.  The plotting system is, however, based on the
traditional (x, y) system.  To minimize the difference between the two
systems Octave places the origin of the coordinate system in the point
corresponding to the pixel at (1, 1).  So, to plot points given by row
and column values on top of an image, one should simply call `plot'
with the column values as the first argument and the row values as the
second.  As an example the following code generates an image with
random intensities between 0 and 1, and shows the image with red
circles over pixels with an intensity above 0.99.

     I = rand (100, 100);
     [row, col] = find (I > 0.99);
     hold ("on");
     imshow (I);
     plot (col, row, "ro");
     hold ("off");

31.5 Color Conversion
=====================

Octave supports conversion from the RGB color system to NTSC and HSV
and vice versa.

 -- Function File: HSV_MAP = rgb2hsv (RGB_MAP)
     Transform a colormap or image from the rgb space to the hsv space.

     A color n the RGB space consists of the red, green and blue
     intensities.

     In the HSV space each color is represented by their hue, saturation
     and value (brightness).  Value gives the amount of light in the
     color.  Hue describes the dominant wavelength.  Saturation is the
     amount of Hue mixed into the color.

     *See also:* *note hsv2rgb: doc-hsv2rgb.

 -- Function File: RGB_MAP = hsv2rgb (HSV_MAP)
     Transform a colormap or image from the hsv space to the rgb space.

32 Audio Processing
*******************

Octave provides a few functions for dealing with audio data.  An audio
`sample' is a single output value from an A/D converter, i.e., a small
integer number (usually 8 or 16 bits), and audio data is just a series
of such samples.  It can be characterized by three parameters:  the
sampling rate (measured in samples per second or Hz, e.g., 8000 or
44100), the number of bits per sample (e.g., 8 or 16), and the number of
channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo, etc.).

   There are many different formats for representing such data.
Currently, only the two most popular, _linear encoding_ and _mu-law
encoding_, are supported by Octave.  There is an excellent FAQ on audio
formats by Guido van Rossum <guido@cwi.nl> which can be found at any
FAQ ftp site, in particular in the directory
`/pub/usenet/news.answers/audio-fmts' of the archive site
`rtfm.mit.edu'.

   Octave simply treats audio data as vectors of samples (non-mono data
are not supported yet).  It is assumed that audio files using linear
encoding have one of the extensions `lin' or `raw', and that files
holding data in mu-law encoding end in `au', `mu', or `snd'.

 -- Function File:  lin2mu (X, N)
     Converts audio data from linear to mu-law.  Mu-law values use 8-bit
     unsigned integers.  Linear values use N-bit signed integers or
     floating point values in the range -1<=X<=1 if N is 0.  If N is
     not specified it defaults to 0, 8 or 16 depending on the range
     values in X.

     doc-loadaudio, *note saveaudio: doc-saveaudio, *note playaudio:
     doc-playaudio, *note setaudio: doc-setaudio, *note record:
     doc-record.

 -- Function File:  mu2lin (X, BPS)
     Converts audio data from linear to mu-law.  Mu-law values are 8-bit
     unsigned integers.  Linear values use N-bit signed integers or
     floating point values in the range -1<=y<=1 if N is 0.  If N is
     not specified it defaults to 8.

     doc-playaudio, *note setaudio: doc-setaudio, *note record:
     doc-record.

 -- Function File:  loadaudio (NAME, EXT, BPS)
     Loads audio data from the file `NAME.EXT' into the vector X.

     The extension EXT determines how the data in the audio file is
     interpreted;  the extensions `lin' (default) and `raw' correspond
     to linear, the extensions `au', `mu', or `snd' to mu-law encoding.

     The argument BPS can be either 8 (default) or 16, and specifies
     the number of bits per sample used in the audio file.

     *note saveaudio: doc-saveaudio, *note playaudio: doc-playaudio,
     *note setaudio: doc-setaudio, *note record: doc-record.

 -- Function File:  saveaudio (NAME, X, EXT, BPS)
     Saves a vector X of audio data to the file `NAME.EXT'.  The
     optional parameters EXT and BPS determine the encoding and the
     number of bits per sample used in the audio file (see
     `loadaudio');  defaults are `lin' and 8, respectively.

     *note setaudio: doc-setaudio, *note record: doc-record.

   The following functions for audio I/O require special A/D hardware
and operating system support.  It is assumed that audio data in linear
encoding can be played and recorded by reading from and writing to
`/dev/dsp', and that similarly `/dev/audio' is used for mu-law
encoding.  These file names are system-dependent.  Improvements so that
these functions will work without modification on a wide variety of
hardware are welcome.

 -- Function File:  playaudio (NAME, EXT)
 -- Function File:  playaudio (X)
     Plays the audio file `NAME.EXT' or the audio data stored in the
     vector X.

     *note loadaudio: doc-loadaudio, *note saveaudio: doc-saveaudio,
     *note setaudio: doc-setaudio, *note record: doc-record.

 -- Function File:  record (SEC, SAMPLING_RATE)
     Records SEC seconds of audio input into the vector X.  The default
     value for SAMPLING_RATE is 8000 samples per second, or 8kHz.  The
     program waits until the user types <RET> and then immediately
     starts to record.

 -- Function File:  setaudio ([W_TYPE [, VALUE]])
     Execute the shell command `mixer [W_TYPE [, VALUE]]'

 -- Function File: Y = wavread (FILENAME)
     Load the RIFF/WAVE sound file FILENAME, and return the samples in
     vector Y.  If the file contains multichannel data, then Y is a
     matrix with the channels represented as columns.

 -- Function File: [Y, FS, BITS] = wavread (FILENAME)
     Additionally return the sample rate (FS) in Hz and the number of
     bits per sample (BITS).

 -- Function File: [...] = wavread (FILENAME, N)
     Read only the first N samples from each channel.

 -- Function File: [...] = wavread (FILENAME,[N1 N2])
     Read only samples N1 through N2 from each channel.

 -- Function File: [SAMPLES, CHANNELS] = wavread (FILENAME, "size")
     Return the number of samples (N) and channels (CH) instead of the
     audio data.

     *See also:* *note wavwrite: doc-wavwrite.

 -- Function File:  wavwrite (Y, FILENAME)
 -- Function File:  wavwrite (Y, FS, FILENAME)
 -- Function File:  wavwrite (Y, FS, BITS, FILENAME)
     Write Y to the canonical RIFF/WAVE sound file FILENAME with sample
     rate FS and bits per sample BITS.  The default sample rate is 8000
     Hz with 16-bits per sample.  Each column of the data represents a
     separate channel.

33 Object Oriented Programming
******************************

Octave includes the capability to include user classes, including the
features of operator and function overloading.  Equally a user class
can be used to encapsulate certain properties of the class so that they
cannot be altered accidentally and can be set up to address the issue
of class precedence in mixed class operations.

   This chapter discussions the means of constructing a user class with
the example of a polynomial class, how to query and set the properties
of this class, together with the means to overload operators and
functions.

* Overloading Objects::
* Inheritance and Aggregation::


File: octave.info,  Node: Creating a Class,  Next: Manipulating Classes,  Up: Object Oriented Programming

33.1 Creating a Class
=====================

We use in the following text a polynomial class to demonstrate the use
of object oriented programming within Octave.  This class was chosen as
it is simple, and so doesn't distract unnecessarily from the discussion
of the programming features of Octave.  However, even still a small
understand of the polynomial class itself is necessary to fully grasp
the techniques described.

   The polynomial class is used to represent polynomials of the form

     a0 + a1 * x + a2 * x^2 + ... + an * x^n

where a0, a1, etc. are real scalars.  Thus the polynomial can be
represented by a vector

     a = [a0, a1, a2, ..., an];

   We therefore now have sufficient information about the requirements
of the class constructor for our polynomial class to write it.  All
object oriented classes in Octave, must be contained with a directory
taking the name of the class, prepended with the @ symbol.  For
example, with our polynomial class, we would place the methods defining
the class in the @polynomial directory.

   The constructor of the class, must have the name of the class itself
and so in our example the constructor with have the name
`@polynomial/polynomial.m'.  Also ideally when the constructor is
called with no arguments to should return a value object.  So for
example our polynomial might look like

     ## -*- texinfo -*-
     ## @deftypefn {Function File} {} polynomial ()
     ## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} polynomial (@var{a})
     ## Creates a polynomial object representing the polynomial
     ##
     ## @example
     ## a0 + a1 * x + a2 * x^2 + @dots{} + an * x^n
     ## @end example
     ##
     ## from a vector of coefficients [a0 a1 a2 ... an].
     ## @end deftypefn

     function p = polynomial (a)
       if (nargin == 0)
         p.poly = [0];
         p = class (p, "polynomial");
       elseif (nargin == 1)
         if (strcmp (class (a), "polynomial"))
           p = a;
         elseif (isvector (a) && isreal (a))
           p.poly = a(:).';
           p = class (p, "polynomial");
         else
           error ("polynomial: expecting real vector");
         endif
       else
         print_usage ();
       endif
     endfunction

   Note that the return value of the constructor must be the output of
the `class' function called with the first argument being a structure
and the second argument being the class name.  An example of the call
to this constructor function is then

     p = polynomial ([1, 0, 1]);

   Note that methods of a class can be documented.  The help for the
constructor itself can be obtained with the constructor name, that is
for the polynomial constructor `help polynomial' will return the help
string.  Also the help can be obtained by restricting the search for
the help to a particular class, for example `help
@polynomial/polynomial'.  This second method is the only means of
getting help for the overloaded methods and functions of the class.

   The same is true for other Octave functions that take a function name
as an argument.  For example `type @polynomial/display' will print the
code of the display method of the polynomial class to the screen, and
`dbstop @polynomial/display' will set a breakpoint at the first
executable line of the display method of the polynomial class.

   To check where a variable is a user class, the `isobject' and `isa'
functions can be used. for example

     p = polynomial ([1, 0, 1]);
     isobject (p)
     => 1
     isa (p, "polynomial")
     => 1

 -- Built-in Function:  isobject (X)
     Return true if X is a class object.

The available methods of a class can be displayed with the `methods'
function.

 -- Built-in Function:  methods (X)
 -- Built-in Function:  methods ("classname")
     Return a cell array containing the names of the methods for the
     object X or the named class.

To inquire whether a particular method is available to a user class, the
`ismethod' function can be used.

 -- Built-in Function:  ismethod (X, METHOD)
     Return true if X is a class object and the string METHOD is a
     method of this class.

For example

     p = polynomial ([1, 0, 1]);
     ismethod (p, "roots")
     => 1

33.2 Manipulating Classes
=========================

There are a number of basic classes methods that can be defined to allow
the contents of the classes to be queried and set.  The most basic of
these is the `display' method.  The `display' method is used by Octave
when displaying a class on the screen, due to an expression that is not
terminated with a semicolon.  If this method is not defined, then
Octave will printed nothing when displaying the contents of a class.

 -- Function File:  display (A)
     Display the contents of an object.  If A is an object of the class
     "myclass", then `display' is called in a case like

          myclass (...)

     where Octave is required to display the contents of a variable of
     the type "myclass".

     *See also:* *note class: doc-class, *note subsref: doc-subsref,
     *note subsasgn: doc-subsasgn.

An example of a display method for the polynomial class might be

     function display (p)
       a = p.poly;
       first = true;
       fprintf("%s =", inputname(1));
       for i = 1 : length (a);
         if (a(i) != 0)
           if (first)
             first = false;
           elseif (a(i) > 0)
             fprintf (" +");
           endif
           if (a(i) < 0)
             fprintf (" -");
           endif
           if (i == 1)
             fprintf (" %g", abs (a(i)));
           elseif (abs(a(i)) != 1)
             fprintf (" %g *", abs (a(i)));
           endif
           if (i > 1)
             fprintf (" X");
           endif
           if (i > 2)
             fprintf (" ^ %d", i - 1);
           endif
         endif
       endfor
       if (first)
         fprintf(" 0");
       endif
       fprintf("\n");
     endfunction

Note that in the display method, it makes sense to start the method
with the line `fprintf("%s =", inputname(1))' to be consistent with the
rest of Octave and print the variable name to be displayed when
displaying the class.

   To be consistent with the Octave graphic handle classes, a class
should also define the `get' and `set' methods.  The `get' method
should accept one or two arguments, and given one argument of the
appropriate class it should return a structure with all of the
properties of the class.  For example

     function s = get (p, f)
       if (nargin == 1)
         s.poly = p.poly;
       elseif (nargin == 2)
         if (ischar (f))
           switch (f)
             case "poly"
               s = p.poly;
             otherwise
               error ("get: invalid property %s", f);
           endswitch
         else
           error ("get: expecting the property to be a string");
         endif
       else
         print_usage ();
       endif
     endfunction

Similarly, the `set' method should taken as its first argument an
object to modify, and then take property/value pairs to be modified.

     function s = set (p, varargin)
       s = p;
       if (length (varargin) < 2 || rem (length (varargin), 2) != 0)
         error ("set: expecting property/value pairs");
       endif
       while (length (varargin) > 1)
         prop = varargin{1};
         val = varargin{2};
         varargin(1:2) = [];
         if (ischar (prop) && strcmp (prop, "poly"))
           if (isvector (val) && isreal (val))
             s.poly = val(:).';
           else
             error ("set: expecting the value to be a real vector");
           endif
         else
           error ("set: invalid property of polynomial class");
         endif
       endwhile
     endfunction

Note that as Octave does not implement pass by reference, than the
modified object is the return value of the `set' method and it must be
called like

     p = set (p, "a", [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]);

Also the `set' method makes use of the `subsasgn' method of the class,
and this method must be defined.  The `subsasgn' method is discussed in
the next section.

   Finally, user classes can be considered as a special type of a
structure, and so they can be saved to a file in the same manner as a
structure.  For example

     p = polynomial ([1, 0, 1]);
     save userclass.mat p
     clear p
     load userclass.mat

All of the file formats supported by `save' and `load' are supported.
In certain circumstances, a user class might either contain a field
that it makes no sense to save or a field that needs to be initialized
before it is saved.  This can be done with the `saveobj' method of the
class

 -- Function File: B = saveobj (A)
     Method of a class to manipulate an object prior to saving it to a
     file.  The function `saveobj' is called when the object A is saved
     using the `save' function.  An example of the use of `saveobj'
     might be to remove fields of the object that don't make sense to
     be saved or it might be used to ensure that certain fields of the
     object are initialized before the object is saved.  For example

          function b = saveobj (a)
            b = a;
            if (isempty (b.field))
               b.field = initfield(b);
            endif
          endfunction

     *See also:* *note loadobj: doc-loadobj, *note class: doc-class.

`saveobj' is called just prior to saving the class to a file.  Likely,
the `loadobj' method is called just after a class is loaded from a
file, and can be used to ensure that any removed fields are reinserted
into the user object.

 -- Function File: B = loadobj (A)
     Method of a class to manipulate an object after loading it from a
     file.  The function `loadobj' is called when the object A is loaded
     using the `load' function.  An example of the use of `saveobj'
     might be to add fields to an object that don't make sense to be
     saved.  For example

          function b = loadobj (a)
            b = a;
            b.addmissingfield = addfield (b);
          endfunction

33.3 Indexing Objects
=====================

Objects can be indexed with parentheses, either like `A (IDX)' or like
`A {IDX}', or even like `A (IDX).FIELD'.  However, it is up to the user
to decide what this indexing actually means.  In the case of our
polynomial class `P (N)' might mean either the coefficient of the N-th
power of the polynomial, or it might be the evaluation of the
polynomial at N.  The meaning of this subscripted referencing is
determined by the `subsref' method.

 -- Built-in Function:  subsref (VAL, IDX)
     Perform the subscripted element selection operation according to
     the subscript specified by IDX.

     The subscript IDX is expected to be a structure array with fields
     `type' and `subs'.  Valid values for `type' are `"()"', `"{}"',
     and `"."'.  The `subs' field may be either `":"' or a cell array
     of index values.

     The following example shows how to extract the two first columns of
     a matrix

          val = magic(3)
               => val = [ 8   1   6
                          3   5   7
                          4   9   2 ]
          idx.type = "()";
          idx.subs = {":", 1:2};
          subsref(val, idx)
               => [ 8   1
                    3   5
                    4   9 ]

     Note that this is the same as writing `val(:,1:2)'.

     *See also:* *note subsasgn: doc-subsasgn, *note substruct:
     doc-substruct.

   For example we might decide that indexing with "()" evaluates the
polynomial and indexing with "{}" returns the N-th coefficient (of N-th
power).  In this case the `subsref' method of our polynomial class
might look like

     function b = subsref (a, s)
       if (isempty (s))
         error ("polynomial: missing index");
       endif
       switch (s(1).type)
         case "()"
           ind = s(1).subs;
           if (numel (ind) != 1)
             error ("polynomial: need exactly one index");
           else
             b = polyval (fliplr (a.poly), ind{1});
           endif
         case "{}"
           ind = s(1).subs;
           if (numel (ind) != 1)
             error ("polynomial: need exactly one index");
           else
             b = a.poly(ind{1}+1);
           endif
         case "."
           fld = s.subs;
           if (strcmp (fld, "poly"))
             b = a.poly;
           else
             error ("@polynomial/subsref: invalid property \"%s\"", fld);
           endif
         otherwise
           error ("invalid subscript type");
       endswitch
       if (numel (s) > 1)
         b = subsref (b, s(2:end));
       endif
     endfunction

   The equivalent functionality for subscripted assignments uses the
`subsasgn' method.

 -- Built-in Function:  subsasgn (VAL, IDX, RHS)
     Perform the subscripted assignment operation according to the
     subscript specified by IDX.

     The subscript IDX is expected to be a structure array with fields
     `type' and `subs'.  Valid values for `type' are `"()"', `"{}"',
     and `"."'.  The `subs' field may be either `":"' or a cell array
     of index values.

     The following example shows how to set the two first columns of a
     3-by-3 matrix to zero.

          val = magic(3);
          idx.type = "()";
          idx.subs = {":", 1:2};
          subsasgn (val, idx, 0)
               => [ 0   0   6
                    0   0   7
                    0   0   2 ]

     Note that this is the same as writing `val(:,1:2) = 0'.

     *See also:* *note subsref: doc-subsref, *note substruct:
     doc-substruct.

   Note that the `subsref' and `subsasgn' methods always receive the
whole index chain, while they usually handle only the first element.
It is the responsibility of these methods to handle the rest of the
chain (if needed), usually by forwarding it again to `subsref' or
`subsasgn'.

   If you wish to use the `end' keyword in subscripted expressions of
an object, then the user needs to define the `end' method for the class.

   For example the `end' method for our polynomial class might look like

     function r = end (obj, index_pos, num_indices)

       if (num_indices != 1)
         error ("polynomial object may only have one index")
       endif

       r = length (obj.poly) - 1;

     endfunction

which is a fairly generic `end' method that has a behavior similar to
the `end' keyword for Octave Array classes.  It can then be used for
example like

     p = polynomial([1,2,3,4]);
     p(end-1)
     => 3

   Objects can also be used as the index in a subscripted expression
themselves and this is controlled with the `subsindex' function.

 -- Function File: IDX = subsindex (A)
     Convert an object to an index vector.  When A is a class object
     defined with a class constructor, then `subsindex' is the
     overloading method that allows the conversion of this class object
     to a valid indexing vector.  It is important to note that
     `subsindex' must return a zero-based real integer vector of the
     class "double".  For example, if the class constructor

          function b = myclass (a)
           b = myclass (struct ("a", a), "myclass");
          endfunction

     then the `subsindex' function

          function idx = subsindex (a)
           idx = double (a.a) - 1.0;
          endfunction

     can then be used as follows

          a = myclass (1:4);
          b = 1:10;
          b(a)
          => 1  2  3  4

     *See also:* *note class: doc-class, *note subsref: doc-subsref,
     *note subsasgn: doc-subsasgn.

   Finally, objects can equally be used like ranges, using the `colon'
method

 -- Function File: R = colon (A, B)
 -- Function File: R = colon (A, B, C)
     Method of a class to construct a range with the `:' operator.  For
     example.

          a = myclass (...)
          b = myclass (...)
          c = a : b

33.4.1 Function Overloading
---------------------------

Any Octave function can be overloaded, and allows a object specific
version of this function to be called as needed.  A pertinent example
for our polynomial class might be to overload the `polyval' function
like

     function [y, dy] = polyval (p, varargin)
       if (nargout == 2)
         [y, dy] = polyval (fliplr(p.poly), varargin{:});
       else
         y = polyval (fliplr(p.poly), varargin{:});
       endif
     endfunction

   This function just hands off the work to the normal Octave `polyval'
function.  Another interesting example for an overloaded function for
our polynomial class is the `plot' function.

     function h = plot(p, varargin)
       n = 128;
       rmax = max (abs (roots (p.poly)));
       x = [0 : (n - 1)] / (n - 1) * 2.2 * rmax - 1.1 * rmax;
       if (nargout > 0)
         h = plot(x, p(x), varargin{:});
       else
         plot(x, p(x), varargin{:});
       endif
     endfunction

which allows polynomials to be plotted in the domain near the region of
the roots of the polynomial.

   Functions that are of particular interest to be overloaded are the
class conversion functions such as `double'.  Overloading these
functions allows the `cast' function to work with the user class and
can aid in the use of methods of other classes with the user class.  An
example `double' function for our polynomial class might look like.

     function b = double (a)
       b = a.poly;
     endfunction

33.4.3 Precedence of Objects
----------------------------

Many functions and operators take two or more arguments and so the case
can easily arise that these functions are called with objects of
different classes.  It is therefore necessary to determine the
precedence of which method of which class to call when there are mixed
objects given to a function or operator.  To do this the `superiorto'
and `inferiorto' functions can be used

 -- Built-in Function:  superiorto (CLASS_NAME, ...)
     When called from a class constructor, mark the object currently
     constructed as having a higher precedence than CLASS_NAME.  More
     that one such class can be specified in a single call.  This
     function may only be called from a class constructor.

 -- Built-in Function:  inferiorto (CLASS_NAME, ...)
     When called from a class constructor, mark the object currently
     constructed as having a lower precedence than CLASS_NAME.  More
     that one such class can be specified in a single call.  This
     function may only be called from a class constructor.

   For example with our polynomial class consider the case

     2 * polynomial ([1, 0, 1]);

That mixes an object of the class "double" with an object of the class
"polynomial".  In this case we like to ensure that the return type of
the above is of the type "polynomial" and so we use the `superiorto'
function in the class constructor.  In particular our polynomial class
constructor would be modified to be

     ## -*- texinfo -*-

33.5 Inheritance and Aggregation
================================

Using classes to build new classes is supported by octave through the
use of both inheritance and aggregation.

   Class inheritance is provided by octave using the `class' function
in the class constructor.  As in the case of the polynomial class, the
octave programmer will create a struct that contains the data fields
required by the class, and then call the class function to indicate
that an object is to be created from the struct.  Creating a child of
an existing object is done by creating an object of the parent class
and providing that object as the third argument of the class function.

   This is easily demonstrated by example.  Suppose the programmer needs
an FIR filter, i.e. a filter with a numerator polynomial but a unity
denominator polynomial.  In traditional octave programming, this would
be performed as follows.

     octave:1> x = [some data vector];
     octave:2> n = [some coefficient vector];
     octave:3> y = filter (n, 1, x);

   The equivalent class could be implemented in a class directory
@FIRfilter that is on the octave path.  The constructor is a file
FIRfilter.m in the class directory.

     ## -*- texinfo -*-
     ## @deftypefn {Function File} {} FIRfilter ()
     ## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} FIRfilter (@var{p})
     ## Creates an FIR filter with polynomial @var{p} as
     ## coefficient vector.
     ##
     ## @end deftypefn

     function f = FIRfilter (p)

       f.polynomial = [];
       if (nargin == 0)
         p = @polynomial ([1]);
       elseif (nargin == 1)
         if (!isa (p, "polynomial"))
           error ("FIRfilter: expecting polynomial as input argument");
         endif
       else
         print_usage ();
       endif
       f = class (f, "FIRfilter", p);
     endfunction

   As before, the leading comments provide command-line documentation
for the class constructor.  This constructor is very similar to the
polynomial class constructor, except that we pass a polynomial object
as the third argument to the class function, telling octave that the
FIRfilter class will be derived from the polynomial class.  Our FIR
filter does not have any data fields, but we must provide a struct to
the `class' function.  The `class' function will add an element named
polynomial to the object struct, so we simply add a dummy element named
polynomial as the first line of the constructor.  This dummy element
will be overwritten by the class function.

   Note further that all our examples provide for the case in which no
arguments are supplied.  This is important since octave will call the
constructor with no arguments when loading ojects from save files to
determine the inheritance structure.

   A class may be a child of more than one class (see the documentation
for the `class' function), and inheritance may be nested.  There is no
limitation to the number of parents or the level of nesting other than
memory or other physical issues.

   As before, we need a `display' method.  A simple example might be

     function display (f)

       display(f.polynomial);

     endfunction

   Note that we have used the polynomial field of the struct to display
the filter coefficients.

   Once we have the class constructor and display method, we may create
an object by calling the class constructor.  We may also check the
class type and examine the underlying structure.

     octave:1> f=FIRfilter(polynomial([1 1 1]/3))
     f.polynomial = 0.333333 + 0.333333 * X + 0.333333 * X ^ 2
     octave:2> class(f)
     ans = FIRfilter
     octave:3> isa(f,"FIRfilter")
     ans =  1
     octave:4> isa(f,"polynomial")
     ans =  1
     octave:5> struct(f)
     ans =
     {
     polynomial = 0.333333 + 0.333333 * X + 0.333333 * X ^ 2
     }

   We only need to define a method to actually process data with our
filter and our class is usable.  It is also useful to provide a means
of changing the data stored in the class.  Since the fields in the
underlying struct are private by default, we could provide a mechanism
to access the fields.  The `subsref' method may be used for both.

     function out = subsref (f, x)
       switch x.type
         case "()"
           n = f.polynomial;
           out = filter(n.poly, 1, x.subs{1});
         case "."
           fld = x.subs;
           if (strcmp (fld, "polynomial"))
             out = f.polynomial;
           else
             error ("@FIRfilter/subsref: invalid property \"%s\"", fld);
           endif
         otherwise
           error ("@FIRfilter/subsref: invalid subscript type for FIR filter");
       endswitch
     endfunction

   The "()" case allows us to filter data using the polynomial provided
to the constructor.

     octave:2> f=FIRfilter(polynomial([1 1 1]/3));
     octave:3> x=ones(5,1);
     octave:4> y=f(x)
     y =

        0.33333
        0.66667
        1.00000
        1.00000
        1.00000

   The "." case allows us to view the contents of the polynomial field.

     octave:1> f=FIRfilter(polynomial([1 1 1]/3));
     octave:2> f.polynomial
     ans = 0.333333 + 0.333333 * X + 0.333333 * X ^ 2

   In order to change the contents of the object, we need to define a
`subsasgn' method.  For example, we may make the polynomial field
publicly writeable.

     function out = subsasgn (f, index, val)
       switch (index.type)
         case "."
           fld = index.subs;
           if (strcmp (fld, "polynomial"))
             out = f;
             out.polynomial = val;
           else
             error ("@FIRfilter/subsref: invalid property \"%s\"", fld);
           endif
         otherwise
           error ("FIRfilter/subsagn: Invalid index type")
       endswitch
     endfunction

   So that

     octave:6> f=FIRfilter();
     octave:7> f.polynomial = polynomial([1 2 3]);
     f.polynomial = 1 + 2 * X + 3 * X ^ 2

   Defining the FIRfilter class as a child of the polynomial class
implies that and FIRfilter object may be used any place that a
polynomial may be used.  This is not a normal use of a filter, so that
aggregation may be a more sensible design approach.  In this case, the
polynomial is simply a field in the class structure.  A class
constructor for this case might be

     ## -*- texinfo -*-
     ## @deftypefn {Function File} {} FIRfilter ()
     ## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} FIRfilter (@var{p})
     ## Creates an FIR filter with polynomial @var{p} as
     ## coefficient vector.
     ##
     ## @end deftypefn

     function f = FIRfilter (p)

       if (nargin == 0)
         f.polynomial = @polynomial ([1]);
       elseif (nargin == 1)
         if (isa (p, "polynomial"))
           f.polynomial = p;
         else
           error ("FIRfilter: expecting polynomial as input argument");
         endif
       else
         print_usage ();
       endif
       f = class (f, "FIRfilter");
     endfunction

   For our example, the remaining class methods remain unchanged.

34.1 Timing Utilities
=====================

Octave's core set of functions for manipulating time values are
patterned after the corresponding functions from the standard C library.
Several of these functions use a data structure for time that includes
the following elements:

`usec'
     Microseconds after the second (0-999999).

`sec'
     Seconds after the minute (0-61).  This number can be 61 to account
     for leap seconds.

`min'
     Minutes after the hour (0-59).

`hour'
     Hours since midnight (0-23).

`mday'
     Day of the month (1-31).

`mon'
     Months since January (0-11).

`year'
     Years since 1900.

`wday'
     Days since Sunday (0-6).

`yday'
     Days since January 1 (0-365).

`isdst'
     Daylight Savings Time flag.

`zone'
     Time zone.

In the descriptions of the following functions, this structure is
referred to as a TM_STRUCT.

 -- Loadable Function:  time ()
     Return the current time as the number of seconds since the epoch.
     The epoch is referenced to 00:00:00 CUT (Coordinated Universal
     Time) 1 Jan 1970.  For example, on Monday February 17, 1997 at
     07:15:06 CUT, the value returned by `time' was 856163706.

 -- Function File: t = now ()
     Returns the current local time as the number of days since Jan 1,
     0000.  By this reckoning, Jan 1, 1970 is day number 719529.

     The integral part, `floor (now)' corresponds to 00:00:00 today.

     The fractional part, `rem (now, 1)' corresponds to the current
     time on Jan 1, 0000.

     The returned value is also called a "serial date number" (see
     `datenum').

     *See also:* *note clock: doc-clock, *note date: doc-date, *note
     datenum: doc-datenum.

 -- Function File:  ctime (T)
     Convert a value returned from `time' (or any other non-negative
     integer), to the local time and return a string of the same form as
     `asctime'.  The function `ctime (time)' is equivalent to `asctime
     (localtime (time))'.  For example,

          ctime (time ())
               => "Mon Feb 17 01:15:06 1997\n"

 -- Loadable Function:  gmtime (T)
     Given a value returned from time (or any non-negative integer),
     return a time structure corresponding to CUT.  For example,

          gmtime (time ())
               => {
                     usec = 0
                     year = 97
                     mon = 1
                     mday = 17
                     sec = 6
                     zone = CST
                     min = 15
                     wday = 1
                     hour = 7
                     isdst = 0
                     yday = 47
                   }

 -- Loadable Function:  localtime (T)
     Given a value returned from time (or any non-negative integer),
     return a time structure corresponding to the local time zone.

          localtime (time ())
               => {
                     usec = 0
                     year = 97
                     mon = 1

                     min = 15
                     wday = 1
                     hour = 1
                     isdst = 0
                     yday = 47

 -- Loadable Function:  mktime (TM_STRUCT)
     Convert a time structure corresponding to the local time to the
     number of seconds since the epoch.  For example,

          mktime (localtime (time ()))
               => 856163706

     *note datestr: doc-datestr, *note datevec: doc-datevec, *note
     calendar: doc-calendar, *note weekday: doc-weekday.

 -- Function File:  asctime (TM_STRUCT)
     Convert a time structure to a string using the following five-field
     format: Thu Mar 28 08:40:14 1996.  For example,

          asctime (localtime (time ()))
               => "Mon Feb 17 01:15:06 1997\n"

     This is equivalent to `ctime (time ())'.

 -- Loadable Function:  strftime (FMT, TM_STRUCT)
     Format the time structure TM_STRUCT in a flexible way using the
     format string FMT that contains `%' substitutions similar to those
     in `printf'.  Except where noted, substituted fields have a fixed
     size; numeric fields are padded if necessary.  Padding is with
     zeros by default; for fields that display a single number, padding
     can be changed or inhibited by following the `%' with one of the
     modifiers described below.  Unknown field specifiers are copied as
     normal characters.  All other characters are copied to the output
     without change.  For example,

          strftime ("%r (%Z) %A %e %B %Y", localtime (time ()))
               => "01:15:06 AM (CST) Monday 17 February 1997"

     Octave's `strftime' function supports a superset of the ANSI C
     field specifiers.

     Literal character fields:

    `%'
          % character.

    `n'
          Newline character.

    `t'
          Tab character.

     Numeric modifiers (a nonstandard extension):

    `- (dash)'
          Do not pad the field.

    `_ (underscore)'
          Pad the field with spaces.

     Time fields:

    `%H'
          Hour (00-23).

          Hour (01-12).

    `%k'
          Hour (0-23).

          Time in seconds since 00:00:00, Jan 1, 1970 (a nonstandard
          extension).

    `%S'
          Second (00-61).

    `%T'
          Time, 24-hour (hh:mm:ss).

    `%X'
          Locale's time representation (%H:%M:%S).

    `%Z'
          Time zone (EDT), or nothing if no time zone is determinable.

     Date fields:

    `%a'
          Locale's abbreviated weekday name (Sun-Sat).

    `%A'
          Locale's full weekday name, variable length (Sunday-Saturday).

 -- Loadable Function: [TM_STRUCT, NCHARS] = strptime (STR, FMT)
     Convert the string STR to the time structure TM_STRUCT under the
     control of the format string FMT.

     If FMT fails to match, NCHARS is 0; otherwise it is set to the
     position of last matched character plus 1. Always check for this
     unless you're absolutely sure the date string will be parsed
     correctly.

   Most of the remaining functions described in this section are not
patterned after the standard C library.  Some are available for
compatibility with MATLAB and others are provided because they are
useful.

 -- Function File:  clock ()
     Return a vector containing the current year, month (1-12), day
     (1-31), hour (0-23), minute (0-59) and second (0-61).  For example,

          clock ()
               => [ 1993, 8, 20, 4, 56, 1 ]

     The function clock is more accurate on systems that have the
     `gettimeofday' function.

 -- Function File:  date ()
     Return the date as a character string in the form DD-MMM-YY.  For
     example,

          date ()
               => "20-Aug-93"

 -- Function File:  etime (T1, T2)
     Return the difference (in seconds) between two time values
     returned from `clock'.  For example:

          t0 = clock ();
           many computations later...
          elapsed_time = etime (clock (), t0);

     will set the variable `elapsed_time' to the number of seconds since
     the variable `t0' was set.

     Return the CPU time used by your Octave session.  The first output
     is the total time spent executing your process and is equal to the
     sum of second and third outputs, which are the number of CPU
     seconds spent executing in user mode and the number of CPU seconds
     spent executing in system mode, respectively.  If your system does
     not have a way to report CPU time usage, `cputime' returns 0 for
     each of its output values.  Note that because Octave used some CPU
     time to start, it is reasonable to check to see if `cputime' works
     by checking to see if the total CPU time used is nonzero.

 -- Function File:  is_leap_year (YEAR)
     Return 1 if the given year is a leap year and 0 otherwise.  If no
     arguments are provided, `is_leap_year' will use the current year.
     For example,

          is_leap_year (2000)
               => 1

 -- Built-in Function:  tic ()
 -- Built-in Function:  toc ()
     Set or check a wall-clock timer.  Calling `tic' without an output
     argument sets the timer.  Subsequent calls to `toc' return the
     number of seconds since the timer was set.  For example,

          tic ();
          # many computations later...
          elapsed_time = toc ();

     will set the variable `elapsed_time' to the number of seconds since
     the most recent call to the function `tic'.

     If called with one output argument then this function returns a
     scalar of type `uint64' and the wall-clock timer is not started.

          t = tic; sleep (5); (double (tic ()) - double (t)) * 1e-6
               => 5

     Nested timing with `tic' and `toc' is not supported.  Therefore
     `toc' will always return the elapsed time from the most recent
     call to `tic'.

     If you are more interested in the CPU time that your process used,
     you should use the `cputime' function instead.  The `tic' and
     `toc' functions report the actual wall clock time that elapsed
     between the calls.  This may include time spent processing other
     jobs or doing nothing at all.  For example,

          tic (); sleep (5); toc ()
               => 5
          t = cputime (); sleep (5); cputime () - t
               => 0

     (This example also illustrates that the CPU timer may have a fairly
     coarse resolution.)

 -- Built-in Function:  pause (SECONDS)
     Suspend the execution of the program.  If invoked without any
     arguments, Octave waits until you type a character.  With a
     numeric argument, it pauses for the given number of seconds.  For
     example, the following statement prints a message and then waits 5
     seconds before clearing the screen.

          fprintf (stderr, "wait please...\n");
          pause (5);
          clc;

 -- Built-in Function:  sleep (SECONDS)
     Suspend the execution of the program for the given number of
     seconds.

 -- Built-in Function:  usleep (MICROSECONDS)
     Suspend the execution of the program for the given number of
     microseconds.  On systems where it is not possible to sleep for
     periods of time less than one second, `usleep' will pause the
     execution for `round (MICROSECONDS / 1e6)' seconds.

 -- Function File:  datenum (YEAR, MONTH, DAY)
 -- Function File:  datenum (YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR)
 -- Function File:  datenum (YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE)
 -- Function File:  datenum (YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND)
 -- Function File:  datenum (`"date"')
 -- Function File:  datenum (`"date"', P)
     Returns the specified local time as a day number, with Jan 1, 0000
     being day 1.  By this reckoning, Jan 1, 1970 is day number 719529.
     The fractional portion, P, corresponds to the portion of the
     specified day.

     Notes:

        * Years can be negative and/or fractional.

        * Months below 1 are considered to be January.

        * Days of the month start at 1.

        * Days beyond the end of the month go into subsequent months.

        * Days before the beginning of the month go to the previous
          month.

        * Days can be fractional.

     *Warning:* this function does not attempt to handle Julian
     calendars so dates before Octave 15, 1582 are wrong by as much as
     eleven days.  Also be aware that only Roman Catholic countries
     adopted the calendar in 1582.  It took until 1924 for it to be
     adopted everywhere.  See the Wikipedia entry on the Gregorian
     calendar for more details.

     *Warning:* leap seconds are ignored.  A table of leap seconds is
     available on the Wikipedia entry for leap seconds.

     doc-weekday.

 -- Function File: STR = datestr (DATE, [F, [P]])
     Format the given date/time according to the format `f' and return
     the result in STR.  DATE is a serial date number (see `datenum')
     or a date vector (see `datevec').  The value of DATE may also be a
     string or cell array of strings.

     F can be an integer which corresponds to one of the codes in the
     table below, or a date format string.

     P is the year at the start of the century in which two-digit years
     are to be interpreted in.  If not specified, it defaults to the
     current year minus 50.

     For example, the date 730736.65149 (2000-09-07 15:38:09.0934)
     would be formatted as follows:

34.2 Filesystem Utilities
=========================

Octave includes the following functions for renaming and deleting files,
creating, deleting, and reading directories, and for getting information
about the status of files.

 -- Built-in Function: [ERR, MSG] = rename (OLD, NEW)
     Change the name of file OLD to NEW.

     If successful, ERR is 0 and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise,
     ERR is nonzero and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

     *See also:* *note ls: doc-ls, *note dir: doc-dir.

 -- Built-in Function: [ERR, MSG] = link (OLD, NEW)
     Create a new link (also known as a hard link) to an existing file.

     If successful, ERR is 0 and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise,
     ERR is nonzero and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

     *See also:* *note symlink: doc-symlink.

 -- Built-in Function: [ERR, MSG] = symlink (OLD, NEW)
     Create a symbolic link NEW which contains the string OLD.

     If successful, ERR is 0 and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise,
     ERR is nonzero and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

     *See also:* *note link: doc-link, *note readlink: doc-readlink.

 -- Built-in Function: [RESULT, ERR, MSG] = readlink (SYMLINK)
     Read the value of the symbolic link SYMLINK.

     If successful, RESULT contains the contents of the symbolic link
     SYMLINK, ERR is 0 and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise, ERR is
     nonzero and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

     *See also:* *note link: doc-link, *note symlink: doc-symlink.

 -- Built-in Function: [ERR, MSG] = unlink (FILE)
     Delete the file named FILE.

     If successful, ERR is 0 and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise,
     ERR is nonzero and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

 -- Built-in Function: [FILES, ERR, MSG] = readdir (DIR)
     Return names of the files in the directory DIR as a cell array of
     strings.  If an error occurs, return an empty cell array in FILES.

     If successful, ERR is 0 and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise,
     ERR is nonzero and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

     *See also:* *note dir: doc-dir, *note glob: doc-glob.

 -- Built-in Function: [STATUS, MSG, MSGID] = mkdir (DIR)
 -- Built-in Function: [STATUS, MSG, MSGID] = mkdir (PARENT, DIR)
     Create a directory named DIR in the directory PARENT.

     If successful, STATUS is 1, with MSG and MSGID empty character
     strings.  Otherwise, STATUS is 0, MSG contains a system-dependent
     error message, and MSGID contains a unique message identifier.

     *See also:* *note rmdir: doc-rmdir.

 -- Built-in Function: [STATUS, MSG, MSGID] = rmdir (DIR)
 -- Built-in Function: [STATUS, MSG, MSGID] = rmdir (DIR, `"s"')
     Remove the directory named DIR.

     If successful, STATUS is 1, with MSG and MSGID empty character
     strings.  Otherwise, STATUS is 0, MSG contains a system-dependent
     error message, and MSGID contains a unique message identifier.

     If the optional second parameter is supplied with value `"s"',
     recursively remove all subdirectories as well.

     *See also:* *note mkdir: doc-mkdir, *note confirm_recursive_rmdir:
     doc-confirm_recursive_rmdir.

 -- Built-in Function: VAL = confirm_recursive_rmdir ()
 -- Built-in Function: OLD_VAL = confirm_recursive_rmdir (NEW_VAL)
     Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave
     will ask for confirmation before recursively removing a directory
     tree.

 -- Built-in Function: [ERR, MSG] = mkfifo (NAME, MODE)
     Create a FIFO special file named NAME with file mode MODE

     If successful, ERR is 0 and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise,
     ERR is nonzero and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

 -- Built-in Function:  umask (MASK)
     Set the permission mask for file creation.  The parameter MASK is
     an integer, interpreted as an octal number.  If successful,
     returns the previous value of the mask (as an integer to be
     interpreted as an octal number); otherwise an error message is
     printed.

 -- Built-in Function: [INFO, ERR, MSG] = stat (FILE)
 -- Built-in Function: [INFO, ERR, MSG] = lstat (FILE)
     Return a structure S containing the following information about
     FILE.

    `dev'
          ID of device containing a directory entry for this file.

    `ino'
          File number of the file.

    `mode'
          File mode, as an integer.  Use the functions `S_ISREG',
          `S_ISDIR', `S_ISCHR', `S_ISBLK', `S_ISFIFO', `S_ISLNK', or
          `S_ISSOCK' to extract information from this value.

    `modestr'
          File mode, as a string of ten letters or dashes as would be
          returned by `ls -l'.

    `nlink'
          Number of links.

    `uid'
          User ID of file's owner.

    `gid'
          Group ID of file's group.

    `rdev'
          ID of device for block or character special files.

    `size'
          Size in bytes.

    `atime'
          Time of last access in the same form as time values returned
          from `time'.  *Note Timing Utilities::.

    `mtime'
          Time of last modification in the same form as time values
          returned from `time'.  *Note Timing Utilities::.

    `ctime'
          Time of last file status change in the same form as time
          values returned from `time'.  *Note Timing Utilities::.

    `blksize'
          Size of blocks in the file.

    `blocks'
          Number of blocks allocated for file.

     If the call is successful ERR is 0 and MSG is an empty string.  If
     the file does not exist, or some other error occurs, S is an empty
     matrix, ERR is -1, and MSG contains the corresponding system error
     message.

     If FILE is a symbolic link, `stat' will return information about
     the actual file that is referenced by the link.  Use `lstat' if
     you want information about the symbolic link itself.

     For example,

          [s, err, msg] = stat ("/vmlinuz")
                => s =
                  {
                    atime = 855399756
                    rdev = 0

                    uid = 0
                    size = 389218
                    blksize = 4096
                    mtime = 847219094

                    dev = 2049
                  }
               => err = 0
               => msg =

 -- Built-in Function: [INFO, ERR, MSG] = fstat (FID)
     Return information about the open file FID.  See `stat' for a
     description of the contents of INFO.

 -- Function File: [STATUS, MSG, MSGID] = fileattrib (FILE)
     Return information about FILE.

     If successful, STATUS is 1, with RESULT containing a structure
     with the following fields:

    `Name'
          Full name of FILE.

    `archive'
          True if FILE is an archive (Windows).

    `system'
          True if FILE is a system file (Windows).

    `hidden'
          True if FILE is a hidden file (Windows).

    `directory'
          True if FILE is a directory.

    `UserRead'
    `GroupRead'
    `OtherRead'
          True if the user (group; other users) has read permission for
          FILE.

    `UserWrite'
    `GroupWrite'
    `OtherWrite'
          True if the user (group; other users) has write permission for
          FILE.

    `UserExecute'
    `GroupExecute'
    `OtherExecute'
          True if the user (group; other users) has execute permission
          for FILE.
     If an attribute does not apply (i.e., archive on a Unix system)
     then the field is set to NaN.

     directory.

     If FILE contains globbing characters, return information about all
     the matching files.

     *See also:* *note glob: doc-glob.

 -- Function File:  isdir (F)
     Return true if F is a directory.

 -- Built-in Function:  glob (PATTERN)
     Given an array of strings (as a char array or a cell array) in
     PATTERN, return a cell array of file names that match any of them,
     or an empty cell array if no patterns match.  Tilde expansion is
     performed on each of the patterns before looking for matching file
     names.  For example,

          glob ("/vm*")
               => "/vmlinuz"

     *See also:* *note dir: doc-dir, *note ls: doc-ls, *note stat:
     doc-stat, *note readdir: doc-readdir.

 -- Built-in Function:  fnmatch (PATTERN, STRING)
     Return 1 or zero for each element of STRING that matches any of
     the elements of the string array PATTERN, using the rules of
     filename pattern matching.  For example,

          fnmatch ("a*b", {"ab"; "axyzb"; "xyzab"})
               => [ 1; 1; 0 ]

 -- Built-in Function:  file_in_path (PATH, FILE)
 -- Built-in Function:  file_in_path (PATH, FILE, "all")
     Return the absolute name of FILE if it can be found in PATH.  The
     value of PATH should be a colon-separated list of directories in
     the format described for `path'.  If no file is found, return an
     empty matrix.  For example,

          file_in_path (EXEC_PATH, "sh")
               => "/bin/sh"

     If the second argument is a cell array of strings, search each
     directory of the path for element of the cell array and return the
     first that matches.

     If the third optional argument `"all"' is supplied, return a cell
     array containing the list of all files that have the same name in
     the path.  If no files are found, return an empty cell array.

     *See also:* *note file_in_loadpath: doc-file_in_loadpath.

 -- Built-in Function:  tilde_expand (STRING)
     Performs tilde expansion on STRING.  If STRING begins with a tilde
     character, (`~'), all of the characters preceding the first slash
     (or all characters, if there is no slash) are treated as a
     possible user name, and the tilde and the following characters up
     to the slash are replaced by the home directory of the named user.
     If the tilde is followed immediately by a slash, the tilde is
     replaced by the home directory of the user running Octave.  For
     example,

          tilde_expand ("~joeuser/bin")
               => "/home/joeuser/bin"
          tilde_expand ("~/bin")
               => "/home/jwe/bin"

 -- Built-in Function: [CNAME, STATUS, MSG] canonicalize_file_name
          (NAME)
     Return the canonical name of file NAME.

 -- Function File: [STATUS, MSG, MSGID] = movefile (F1, F2)
     Move the file F1 to the new name F2.  The name F1 may contain
     globbing patterns.  If F1 expands to multiple file names, F2 must
     be a directory.

     If successful, STATUS is 1, with MSG and MSGID empty\n\ character
     strings.  Otherwise, STATUS is 0, MSG contains a\n\
     system-dependent error message, and MSGID contains a unique\n\
     message identifier.\n\

     *See also:* *note glob: doc-glob.

 -- Function File: [STATUS, MSG, MSGID] = copyfile (F1, F2, FORCE)
     Copy the file F1 to the new name F2.  The name F1 may contain
     globbing patterns.  If F1 expands to multiple file names, F2 must
     be a directory.  If FORCE is given and equals the string "f" the
     copy operation will be forced.

     If successful, STATUS is 1, with MSG and MSGID empty\n\ character
     strings.  Otherwise, STATUS is 0, MSG contains a\n\
     system-dependent error message, and MSGID contains a unique\n\
     message identifier.\n\

     *See also:* *note glob: doc-glob, *note movefile: doc-movefile.

 -- Function File: [DIR, NAME, EXT, VER] = fileparts (FILENAME)
     Return the directory, name, extension, and version components of
     FILENAME.

     *See also:* *note fullfile: doc-fullfile.

 -- Built-in Function:  filesep ()
 -- Built-in Function:  filesep ('all')
     Return the system-dependent character used to separate directory
     names.

     If 'all' is given, the function return all valid file separators in
     the form of a string.  The list of file separators is
     system-dependent.  It is / (forward slash) under UNIX or Mac OS X,
     / and \ (forward and backward slashes) under Windows.

     *See also:* *note pathsep: doc-pathsep, *note dir: doc-dir, *note
     ls: doc-ls.

 -- Built-in Function:  filemarker ()
     Returns or sets the character used to separate filename from the
     the subfunction names contained within the file.  This can be used
     in a generic manner to interact with subfunctions.  For example

          help (["myfunc", filemarker, "mysubfunc"])

     returns the help string associated with the sub-function
     `mysubfunc' of the function `myfunc'.  Another use of `filemarker'
     is when debugging it allows easier placement of breakpoints within
     sub-functions.  For example

          dbstop (["myfunc", filemarker, "mysubfunc"])

     will set a breakpoint at the first line of the subfunction
     `mysubfunc'.

 -- Function File: FILENAME = fullfile (DIR1, DIR2, ..., FILE)
     Return a complete filename constructed from the given components.

     *See also:* *note fileparts: doc-fileparts.

 -- Function File: DIR = tempdir ()
     Return the name of the system's directory for temporary files.

 -- Function File: filename = tempname ()
     This function is an alias for `tmpnam'.

 -- Built-in Function:  P_tmpdir ()
     Return the default name of the directory for temporary files on
     this system.  The name of this directory is system dependent.

 -- Built-in Function:  is_absolute_filename (FILE)
     Return true if FILE is an absolute filename.

 -- Built-in Function:  is_rooted_relative_filename (FILE)
     Return true if FILE is a rooted-relative filename.

 -- Built-in Function:  make_absolute_filename (FILE)
     Return the full name of FILE, relative to the current directory.

34.5 Controlling Subprocesses
=============================

Octave includes some high-level commands like `system' and `popen' for
starting subprocesses.  If you want to run another program to perform
some task and then look at its output, you will probably want to use
these functions.

   Octave also provides several very low-level Unix-like functions which
can also be used for starting subprocesses, but you should probably only
use them if you can't find any way to do what you need with the
higher-level functions.

 -- Built-in Function:  system (STRING, RETURN_OUTPUT, TYPE)
     Execute a shell command specified by STRING.  The second argument
     is optional.  If TYPE is `"async"', the process is started in the
     background and the process id of the child process is returned
     immediately.  Otherwise, the process is started, and Octave waits
     until it exits.  If the TYPE argument is omitted, a value of
     `"sync"' is assumed.

     If two input arguments are given (the actual value of
     RETURN_OUTPUT is irrelevant) and the subprocess is started
     synchronously, or if SYSTEM is called with one input argument and
     one or more output arguments, the output from the command is
     returned.  Otherwise, if the subprocess is executed synchronously,
     its output is sent to the standard output.  To send the output of
     a command executed with SYSTEM through the pager, use a command
     like

          disp (system (cmd, 1));

     or

          printf ("%s\n", system (cmd, 1));

     The `system' function can return two values.  The first is the
     exit status of the command and the second is any output from the
     command that was written to the standard output stream.  For
     example,

          [status, output] = system ("echo foo; exit 2");

     will set the variable `output' to the string `foo', and the
     variable `status' to the integer `2'.

 -- Function File: [STATUS, TEXT] unix (COMMAND)
 -- Function File: [STATUS, TEXT] unix (COMMAND, "-echo")
     Execute a system command if running under a Unix-like operating
     system, otherwise do nothing.  Return the exit status of the
     program in STATUS and any output sent to the standard output in
     TEXT.  If the optional second argument `"-echo"' is given, then
     also send the output from the command to the standard output.

     *See also:* *note isunix: doc-isunix, *note ispc: doc-ispc, *note
     system: doc-system.

 -- Function File: [STATUS, TEXT] = dos (COMMAND)
 -- Function File: [STATUS, TEXT] = dos (COMMAND, "-echo")
     Execute a system command if running under a Windows-like operating
     system, otherwise do nothing.  Return the exit status of the
     program in STATUS and any output sent to the standard output in
     TEXT.  If the optional second argument `"-echo"' is given, then
     also send the output from the command to the standard output.

     *See also:* *note unix: doc-unix, *note isunix: doc-isunix, *note
     ispc: doc-ispc, *note system: doc-system.

 -- Function File: [OUTPUT, STATUS] = perl (SCRIPTFILE)
 -- Function File: [OUTPUT, STATUS] = perl (SCRIPTFILE, ARGUMENT1,
          ARGUMENT2, ...)
     Invoke perl script SCRIPTFILE with possibly a list of command line
     arguments.  Returns output in OUTPUT and status in STATUS.

     *See also:* *note system: doc-system.

 -- Built-in Function: FID = popen (COMMAND, MODE)
     Start a process and create a pipe.  The name of the command to run
     is given by COMMAND.  The file identifier corresponding to the
     input or output stream of the process is returned in FID.  The
     argument MODE may be

    `"r"'
          The pipe will be connected to the standard output of the
          process, and open for reading.

    `"w"'
          The pipe will be connected to the standard input of the
          process, and open for writing.

     For example,

          fid = popen ("ls -ltr / | tail -3", "r");
          while (ischar (s = fgets (fid)))
            fputs (stdout, s);
          endwhile
               -| drwxr-xr-x  33 root  root  3072 Feb 15 13:28 etc
               -| drwxr-xr-x   3 root  root  1024 Feb 15 13:28 lib
               -| drwxrwxrwt  15 root  root  2048 Feb 17 14:53 tmp

 -- Built-in Function:  pclose (FID)
     Close a file identifier that was opened by `popen'.  You may also
     use `fclose' for the same purpose.

 -- Built-in Function: [IN, OUT, PID] = popen2 (COMMAND, ARGS)
     Start a subprocess with two-way communication.  The name of the
     process is given by COMMAND, and ARGS is an array of strings
     containing options for the command.  The file identifiers for the
     input and output streams of the subprocess are returned in IN and
     OUT.  If execution of the command is successful, PID contains the
     process ID of the subprocess.  Otherwise, PID is -1.

     For example,

          [in, out, pid] = popen2 ("sort", "-r");
          fputs (in, "these\nare\nsome\nstrings\n");
          fclose (in);
          EAGAIN = errno ("EAGAIN");
          done = false;
          do
            s = fgets (out);
            if (ischar (s))
              fputs (stdout, s);
            elseif (errno () == EAGAIN)
              sleep (0.1);
              fclear (out);
            else
              done = true;
            endif
          until (done)
          fclose (out);
               -| are
               -| some
               -| strings
               -| these

 -- Built-in Function: VAL = EXEC_PATH ()
 -- Built-in Function: OLD_VAL = EXEC_PATH (NEW_VAL)
     Query or set the internal variable that specifies a colon separated
     list of directories to search when executing external programs.
     Its initial value is taken from the environment variable
     `OCTAVE_EXEC_PATH' (if it exists) or `PATH', but that value can be
     overridden by the command line argument `--exec-path PATH'.  At
     startup, an additional set of directories (including the shell
     PATH) is appended to the path specified in the environment or on
     the command line.  If you use the `EXEC_PATH' function to modify
     the path, you should take care to preserve these additional
     directories.

   In most cases, the following functions simply decode their arguments
and make the corresponding Unix system calls.  For a complete example
of how they can be used, look at the definition of the function
`popen2'.

 -- Built-in Function: [PID, MSG] = fork ()
     Create a copy of the current process.

     Fork can return one of the following values:

    > 0
          You are in the parent process.  The value returned from
          `fork' is the process id of the child process.  You should
          probably arrange to wait for any child processes to exit.

    0
          You are in the child process.  You can call `exec' to start
          another process.  If that fails, you should probably call
          `exit'.

    < 0
          The call to `fork' failed for some reason.  You must take
          evasive action.  A system dependent error message will be
          waiting in MSG.

 -- Built-in Function: [ERR, MSG] = exec (FILE, ARGS)
     Replace current process with a new process.  Calling `exec' without
     first calling `fork' will terminate your current Octave process and
     replace it with the program named by FILE.  For example,

          exec ("ls" "-l")

     will run `ls' and return you to your shell prompt.

     If successful, `exec' does not return.  If `exec' does return, ERR
     will be nonzero, and MSG will contain a system-dependent error
     message.

 -- Built-in Function: [READ_FD, WRITE_FD, ERR, MSG] = pipe ()
     Create a pipe and return the reading and writing ends of the pipe
     into READ_FD and WRITE_FD respectively.

     If successful, ERR is 0 and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise,
     ERR is nonzero and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

 -- Built-in Function: [FID, MSG] = dup2 (OLD, NEW)
     Duplicate a file descriptor.

     If successful, FID is greater than zero and contains the new file
     ID.  Otherwise, FID is negative and MSG contains a
     system-dependent error message.

 -- Built-in Function: [PID, STATUS, MSG] = waitpid (PID, OPTIONS)
     Wait for process PID to terminate.  The PID argument can be:

    -1
          Wait for any child process.

    0
          Wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal to
          that of the Octave interpreter process.

    > 0
          Wait for termination of the child process with ID PID.

     The OPTIONS argument can be a bitwise OR of zero or more of the
     following constants:

    `0'
          Wait until signal is received or a child process exits (this
          is the default if the OPTIONS argument is missing).

    `WNOHANG'
          Do not hang if status is not immediately available.

    `WUNTRACED'
          Report the status of any child processes that are stopped,
          and whose status has not yet been reported since they stopped.

    `WCONTINUE'
          Return if a stopped child has been resumed by delivery of
          `SIGCONT'.  This value may not be meaningful on all systems.

     If the returned value of PID is greater than 0, it is the process
     ID of the child process that exited.  If an error occurs, PID will
     be less than zero and MSG will contain a system-dependent error
     message.  The value of STATUS contains additional system-dependent
     information about the subprocess that exited.

          ARG.  The only flags that can be changed are `O_APPEND' and
          `O_NONBLOCK'.

     If successful, ERR is 0 and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise,
     ERR is nonzero and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

 -- Built-in Function: [ERR, MSG] = kill (PID, SIG)
     Send signal SIG to process PID.

     If PID is positive, then signal SIG is sent to PID.

     If PID is 0, then signal SIG is sent to every process in the
     process group of the current process.

     If PID is -1, then signal SIG is sent to every process except
     process 1.

     If PID is less than -1, then signal SIG is sent to every process
     in the process group -PID.

     If SIG is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still
     performed.

     Return 0 if successful, otherwise return -1.

 -- Built-in Function:  SIG ()
     Return a structure containing Unix signal names and their defined
     values.
